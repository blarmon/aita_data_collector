# A note: I found this code through reddit user u/kungming2.  praw only let me grab recent submissions unfortunately,
# and this made it very handy to acess the pushshift API to get older submissions to the sub.

    """
    A simple function that returns a list of PRAW submission objects during a particular period from a defined sub.
    This function serves as a replacement for the now deprecated PRAW `submissions()` method.

    :param subreddit: A subreddit name to fetch submissions from.
    :param start: A Unix time integer. Posts fetched will be AFTER this time. (default: None)
    :param end: A Unix time integer. Posts fetched will be BEFORE this time. (default: None)
    :param limit: There needs to be a defined limit of results (default: 100), or Pushshift will return only 25.
    :param extra_query: A query string is optional. If an extra_query string is not supplied,
                        the function will just grab everything from the defined time period. (default: empty string)

    Submissions are yielded newest first.
