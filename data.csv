So last hike (a year ago almost) my friend struggled with foot pain which she said she got every hike. She struggled on the last hike and I told her she needed to go to a physio or podiatrist because she probably needed insoles. 

So fast forward to this hike, she suggested it, I put no pressure on her and I sunk about 700 dollars into the trip. 4 days in her feet are really hurting and she says she can't go on so we cut it short and she also felt she was struggling fitness wise. 

I feel bad that she's in pain but I'm just frustrated that 1) she didn't bother to do anything about this recurring issue and 2) she did absolutely no training whatsoever to prepare herself. And she  kept complaining about how I was going too fast and that she felt inferior because of her fitness. 

The thing is I also have recurring issues and I've gone to the physio trying to correct it. I just feel like she let me down and I wouldn't be upset if it was a new injury etc but the fact that she's had this issue before and didn't do anything about it upsets me.

My friend Joe invited me to Toronto for a NYE party and I went. He convinced me to get a hotel room on the off chance that I did bring a girl back.

We attend the event, all is well and I am dancing with a very attractive young lady who is attempting to teach me how to salsa.

She is also drunk. Not so much that she is incoherent or that she is unresponsive, but she is slurring her words and having trouble staying balanced in her heels.

She seems open to spending the night in my hotel. I decline and send her on her way with her friends who casually mention her boyfriend.

Now for the real asshole part.

We get back to the hotel and while helping drunk Joe into his room while his girlfriend June was talking to people, my friend asks why I didn't bring that girl back.

I tell him she was drunk, she had a boyfriend and that I didn't feel comfortable for two reasons.

1 - I didn't want to risk any sort of claim that I took advantage of someone, because I never want to be seen as that guy.

2 - I didn't want to be the guy that she cheated on her boyfriend with.

Because we weren't sober either, he proceeded to jokingly call me a bitch because he's done it many times before and that I passed up a willing partner to lose my virginity to.

I proceeded to angrily call him a dirtbag because he had taken advantage of girls and physically dropped him in his bed and stormed back to my room where I passed out.

I typically get a couple thousand dollars in grants to pay for school. However, I need my mother to do her taxes. I'm still trying to get aid for the current school year, Fall 2016 - Spring 2017.
 
All my paperwork is turned into my school. The only thing I have left is for her to do her taxes for tax year 2015. Not to make excuses, but she's always terrible when it comes to paperwork, or anything with money. I love the lady, but getting her to do stuff like this is painful. She constantly lies about having done stuff until called out on it, then gets angry and yells till you walk away. 
 
Anyways, she said she needed to get her school payment info for 2015. She went to local community college (CC). She said she can't get into CC account, which is similar to the one I use at my school to get my 1098-T (Tuition tax form.) She claimed to call them in mid December after harassing her for weeks about it. ""It's in the mail,"" I was told. It's still not here and she dodges any attempt to talk about it. 

Today, I decided to try and log into her account myself. I was told she didn't know the username or password. It took my less than 10 minutes to figure out how to reset the password. All I needed was the last four of her social and birthday. She claimed they deactivated it because she didn't enroll in the latest semesters. She stopped after one semester, Fall 2014. Bullshit. Also, I found the tax forms needed. Clearly she made no attempt to log in and check, and I'm sure the school would have told her to just do this instead if she had called. But she chose to lie to me.

There was about three hours between the time my youngest daughter's team and my oldest daughter's team would go on, so we walked around the convention center and got some food to kill time.

While we were sitting on the bleachers eating our food, a man came up to us and told us that a girl on his dance team had just lost her mother in an accident two months ago, and that I looked like her to a tee. He showed me a picture on his phone, and I do have to admit I look a lot like this woman. He told me that she had seen me multiple times throughout the day and each time got upset because she thought I was her mom. I didn't really know what to say so I just said 'that's terrible, I'm so sorry for her loss'.

Then he said that as 'one dance parent to another' he would appreciate it if I would leave, because my presence was too upsetting to the girl on his team and he wanted to be sensitive to her feelings. I was taken aback and just told him that I was waiting for my 12-year-old's team to go on and I couldn't just leave because then no one would be supervising my 9-year-old. He shrugged his shoulders and said 'I hoped you would do the right thing, I suppose I'll have to go talk to the event organizers'.

I was still in shock and my oldest daughter told me we should tell her coach what happened, so we did, because my daughter thought maybe he was trying to somehow sabotage her team? We pointed him out and my daughter's coach said he wasn't the coach of a team they were competing against and not to worry about it, if anyone said anything else he'd deal with them.

No 'event organizer' ever came up and asked me to leave, but word got around within the parents of our team, and most parents thought the guy was way out of line but a couple have suggested that maybe I should have just stayed out of the way so the girl on the other team wouldn't have to see me, and that it would have been kinder to do so. A few parents even said that they wouldn't have minded watching my 9-year-old while I waited out in the car. 

I'm just wondering if I was insensitive to this girl in any way, or if that guy's request was out of line. I thought it was, but if the girl just lost her mom then I wouldn't want to be insensitive.

So like my friends I work and I study, and my friends which study with me are now pissed at me because the following events took place:

In December we had a paper to turn in, and since one of them was a father recently (Let's call him Joe) and the other one is going trough a hard time (Let's call him Pete), I started doing the paper about 2 weeks before the time ends. I'd do one page, or one paragraph and send it to them by e-mail for them to see what was being made. Anyway this keeps going until Joe tells me by e-mail that I was being an individualist by doing all that by myself, and I was somewhat hurt by that because my intentions were to help them since we have so little time (work and school). I said it was not my intention, I just wanted to get work done since I knew they had less time then I did. Anyway, I stopped working on the paper since I already did so much, and I waited for them to turn something over. But days passed and nothing was done, and they even had time to plan a dinner both of them and their wives. So the day before the deadline at about 8pm they send me their parts for me to put everything together and work on the rest of my part.
I did it, but I also sent an e-mail ranting about what happened, since we talked about making everything with time as it should be and not do everything in the last hour as it happened. I also said again that I started doing the paper soon to avoid this, and that the dinner that they both had could wait one more week because the paper had a deadline, the dinner didn't.
Joe got pretty pissed at me because of what I said, and so did Pete.


This time has passed and things are now awkward because Joe still insists that I had no right in saying what I did, and I am starting to feel pretty bad... But I think true friends should share the good and the bad and I think it's what I did. Maybe I am just a freakin asshole... :| thoughts?

There are eight of us all together, and sometimes things can get a little chaotic. The game was pretty exciting and during a big part of an encounter another player and I took a turn together. The GM went next, and did something that incapacitated the female player's character. 

She was, rightfully so, not happy about it because had tried to act earlier but was talked over by me and the other players. She made her disappointment known multiple times as she tried to figure out what she could do with limited ability. I apologized, several times, and agreed that it was wrong that we had talked over her. 

Then I turned to the person running the game and asked if we could spend a valuable resource to allow her to have her turn the way she wanted to take it before we rudely talked over her.

I believe that I had made a sincere effort to apologize, take blame, and try to make it right. I was pretty hurt that she rejected my efforts to apologize. I was even angry that she turned it around onto me specifically when others were to blame but stayed quiet.

I'm 22F.  I was friends for a while with this guy who's in his early forties.  I know, I know.  He started talking to me while I was in high school.  I didn't want to judge a book by its cover, even though my dad repeatedly warned me about him.

Anyway.

I know this guy likes to date young girls, but he never expressed any interest in me.  He always told me he looked at me like a friend and I said the same.  Because I DID see him like a friend and nothing more.  Sometimes he and I would make dumb sex jokes, but he does that with all his friends, and I do that with all of mine.  It was clear to me they were nothing but jokes, especially considering I had a bf at the time and he was way hung up on his ex of like... four years now?  Almost five?

To continue.

Once my long-term boyfriend and I broke up, he immediately started acting different.  Getting mad if I ""talked to guys my own age,"" that kind of stuff.  Getting mad if I didn't text him every day. Getting really possessive.  I asked him if he liked me, he said no.  He kept getting more aggressive in his behavior, and eventually I asked him again and he admitted that he did.  When I explained that I didn't have feelings for him like that, he told me I was ""lying to myself about my feelings"" and that he'd ""never been wrong about a girl liking him before.""

Okay.  Well, he wanted to remain friends but needed some space.  Okay.  I gave him some space, didn't text him every day.  And then he went off on me with a passive-aggressive text about how I wasn't being a good friend because I wasn't talking to him enough.

I couldn't handle it anymore so I decided to cut contact.  I figured that eventually he'd calm down and maybe we could talk things out, but clearly talking hadn't worked at that point so I might as well wait.  I blocked him on Facebook and my phone because he was pretty obsessive with the way he contacted his ex and I didn't want him to do that to me.

When he figured out I'd blocked him, he started following me around online on sites that didn't have a blocking function.  Making fun of my previous suicide attempt on public forums.  He's also been making sexual comments about me, especially about my breasts.

Today he and I finally had a blowup fight.  He was harassing me publicly - again - so I told him he needed to leave me alone.  See, nobody on this site knew that he had confessed to me, as he asked me not to tell anyone.  The only people who knew were people close to me that I'd told.  And, as I know now, the people he told.  I told him publicly that if he didn't leave me alone, I'd make the details of our last few conversations public.

He blew up and started making comments about how I'd led him on, forced him to confess even though he only liked me because he was depressed and he was already getting over it at the time, how I'd ended our friendship in a shxtty way and how he makes fun of everyone so I wasn't allowed to be mad that he was making fun of me.

The majority of the site came to support me - many of them sent me private messages.  About three or four girls have had to leave the site because of his behavior towards them.  One girl defended him, but that's about it.  I assume he's never made advances at her because, as he told me, he only dates girls that are basically in high school/college.

I've been talking to his ex and getting her side of the story about the breakup.  How he posted her nudes online for revenge and sent them to her friends, how he got multiple phone numbers when she blocked his, how he went to her home town to force her to speak with him after she blocked him, how they had sex when she was underage.  All that stuff.

To be honest, I'm feeling pretty good about how I handled things, if a bit stressed.  He complained that I didn't talk to him privately - however, he's really manipulative and he can be really, really nasty when confronted, and I didn't feel comfortable opening the avenue for him to talk to me personally.  I felt like this was a fair response to him not leaving me alone.

Am I crazy?  Am I a prick for telling him his behavior is inappropriate and he needs to leave me alone?

Well moments passed, and he wanted to tell me why. He said a black guy beat him up when he was a kid and took his bike, and for that, he said the black guy was racist and that it was a hate crime.

  My best friend (we'll call him Jared), myself, and a friend of ours (lets call him Carl) all lived in a 3br condo. For the first few months that Carl was living with Jared and me, he slept in the living room (waiting for the remaining tenant from the lease before ours to move out).  Once said tenant moved out, Carl moved into a bedroom.  Fast forward about 5 months.  Jared tells me that his mother is having trouble paying her rent (which isn't uncommon, she's been financially irresponsible for as long as I can remember), and he wants to move her and his little brother into the condo.  He asks if, with enough time, Carl and I would be okay moving out and finding another place.  I am absolutely fine with this, as Jared and his family have let me rent a room from them when I was much younger and got kicked out of my parents house.  I told him it wasn't as issue, and Carl and I began entertaining the idea of finding another place to live.  
  A few weeks later, Jared let me know that he had talked to the landlord, and the landlord was not okay with Jared moving his family in and Carl and I moving out. Upon hearing this news, Jared informed me that he would be moving out of the condo and into an apartment with his mother and brother.  About 2 weeks later, on a Friday, Jared lets me know, in passing, that his mother and brother will be moving into our living room this weekend. I was a little taken back by the abruptness of it all, but I gathered my composure and asked Jared, ""For how long?"". Jared just shrugs his shoulders and tells me, ""I don't know"", and carries on with what he was doing. 
  It is discussed between Jared and Carl and I that his mother would not be paying rent, but instead she would be paying for the internet bill (no more than $50/mo I would imagine).  I wasn't too fond of the idea, but if I were to voice that opinion I'd be considered an asshole by Jared, as his mother is ""moving in so she can save money to find her own place"".  So, Jared's mother and little brother move in.  And having lived with his mother before, I knew how unclean and disorganized of a person she is. I'm talking old dirty dishes piled up for a month, dogs peeing/pooping in the house and it not getting cleaned up, trash littered all throughout the house, not cleaning up after herself, etc.  I would also consider her to be an enabler, and a bit of a hoarder, though I don't really know if that's relevant to this story.  About 2 months go by, and our landlord wants us to start paying utilities (he paid them prior).  I tell Jared that I think that we should split the utilities 5 ways since there's 5 people living there (Myself, Jared, Carl, Jared's little brother [age 14], and Jared's mother).  This greatly upsets Jared, and he tells me I'm an asshole for wanting to charge his 14 year old brother utilities.  I explain to him that whether he lived in our condo or in an apartment with just he and his mother like before, his mother was responsible for paying his utility usage.  Just because he's not old enough to pay the utilities himself, doesn't mean that he doesn't use them.  He plays video games, showers, uses the A/C, etc all of which require electricity, water, and gas.  I ultimately decided that splitting them 4 ways was the only way to keep negligible amount of peace in the house, so that's what we ended up doing.  
  I still feel like the utilities should have been split 5 ways, and I tried asking family for unbiased opinions but they sided with me and I'm not sure if it's just because we're all so like-minded or if I'm really not the asshole.  For what it's worth, we have all gone our separate ways and Jared and I have not spoken since the conversation of the utilities (though his mother and I were cordial whilst living together).  It's extremely awkward living in a 1,200 sq. ft. condo with someone and not speaking to them for 10 months.  This may as well be unrelated to *my* situation, but Jared and his family still owe the landlord about $2,500 from not having paid their rent every month. Carl and I now live with the landlord at his home and have remained friends.  There is literally sooo much more that goes into this story that I feel would help my case, but I want to keep it as concise as possible.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some things.

Tl;dr: Friend moves Mom and little brother into our living room. I want to split the utilities 5 ways since there's 5 people living there and the mom doesn't pay rent.  Am I the asshole?

This event would be followed by a mandatory staff meeting of my department. I don't own any superhero shirts, so I didn't think I would go, but on Wednesday, I heard the manager talking to someone else about his impressive collection of superhero shirts. I was intrigued, and asked him nicely then and there if he was willing to lend me one of his shirts, since we took the same size. He said he was happy too, and we agreed that he would bring it on the day of, I would wear it over top of the shirt I came in for a few hours, and then give it back to him before the meeting started. The whole interaction was very positive.

Now we'll skip ahead to Saturday night, or more accurately, 1 AM on Sunday morning. I hadn't spoken about the event to this manager since Wednesday, and I had last been at work on Thursday, so I knew a confirmation message was called for. I was still a little unsure until about exactly that time, though, so I decided to message him on Facebook right away. I texted, and I quote ""I'll be coming to the superhero party tomorrow, so please bring a shirt for me! Thanks"". Not the most formal interaction, I admit, but I thought that because it had already discussed, I didn't need to go through all the formalities, and that doing so again might even be strange. I didn't think he'd be awake to see it, but I knew he only lived a block away from work, and that he would have his bag with him anyways, so it should be no trouble.

Anyways, I went to bed and then woke up at 9:45. I saw there was a text from 8:15 that just read ""Are you kidding me?"" This is a somewhat ambiguous message that does lean towards the negative, but I decided not to respond. I should also mention that I largely do not communicate with this manager online, only face to face, and thus did not know their online mannerisms, making me more unsure about how to interpret this message.

Anyways, I arrive at the office about 20 minutes before the event starts. A fair amount of people are already there, including the manager. I say hi, and he almost immediately begins chewing me out in front of multiple other staff members. He said he did not appreciate being asked at 1 AM for a shirt of his, and he did not appreciate my ""tone."" He even said he hoped I had been drunk and it had impaired my judgement, to which I stretched the truth and said I had been--in reality, I had had a couple of drinks, but I had felt fairly sober and said basically the same thing I would have otherwise. I tried to probe a little to exactly what part of it upset him, and it seemed to strictly be the time that I sent it at. He made it out to seem like not enough notice at all. I asked him if he remembered our conversation on Wednesday, and he said he did, but that texting him at 1 in the morning was just not right. It hadn't woken him up or anything, but it struck the wrong chord with him. His whole argument seemed rather silly to me, but I knew I shouldn't press, so I acquiesced.

He then immediately switched to a cheery demeanour and took me to his bag, where he showed me 3 or 4 other shirts, which I knew made up most of his collection. I picked the one I liked the most, he happily gave it to me, and he went to another part of the office.

The event went fine. I didn't talk to him much during it, but I could see that he had worn his coolest shirt, and that he was getting more compliments on his than I was mine, which I was totally fine with. At the end of the event, I went up to him and gave him back his shirt. There was again no hint of animosity, and he simply asked if I had had a good time and if people had liked my shirt. He then told me some of the compliments he got on his. He left shortly after, since he wasn't part of my department.

So, Reddit, is his behaviour justified considering all the circumstances? How do you suggest I not upset him if another event like this one happens in the future and I need his help again?

I home school my daughter through a virtual school, meaning that she takes classes online for a few hours a day and then we do at home learning for the rest of the day.

My mom and my aunt decided that since I don't work I should drive over there ( about a half hour away) and take care of her everyday. I told them that I can't do that because my daughter has to be in school, my daughter also has some learning issues and when things get off schedule she gets really out of whack. So for the last two days they have been mad and trying to make me feel guilty because I won't drop everything and go take care of her. When I tell them that she needs professional help they tell me that she doesn't want that and that they can't make her do anything she doesn't want to.  
On top of all that I just emotionally don't want to have to go there everyday and sit and watch her die, because like they said, we can't make her do anything she doesn't want to and that includes eating and taking care of herself.

Well the annual fee is about to come out, I’ve realized that I really just don’t use it that much and it’s not worth the cost, at all. I’m perfectly content cancelling it but since they all rely on it I decided on a solution. So I’ve contacted everyone that uses it as (about 3 people in all) and said that if they could chip in for the fee I’d keep it. Well everyone but one person have agreed to chipping in. 

The conversation went along the lines of 

Me saying that in order not to cancel it I’m asking people to chip in $25 so that I don’t need to bear the cost. 

Him saying that I can go ahead and cancel because it’ll stop him from spending his money “haha” 

Me saying that if he needs a solution to his impulsive spending I could just change the password “haha” 

Him complaining that it would affect his Amazon Turk stuff (Which, by the way, he went into without my permission on my account, changing my info (I did not use it but he could have at least asked…)) and that he really does not use it too often and that not even all of his purchases are “Prime” eligible

My saying that I only agreed to let him use Turk until his own account was verified 

Him saying that it won’t get verified until next week so I can change it then

At which point the conversation tapers off into discussion about passive income stuff.

This seems like the perfect sub to ask this question. So if you're willing to answer on those grounds, here's the hypothetical.

My father is very sick and needs a replacement kidney. He's on a wait list and may get chosen to receive a suitable donor organ. His doctor says the chances of getting the organ he needs before he dies are quite good, but not good enough to make any promises...and it is certain that there will be a lot of suffering and serious medical procedures necessitated while he waits, so he would be much better off finding a compatible donor to volunteer ASAP.

He asked his extended family, including me, and I told him I would take whatever test there is to see if I'm a viable donor. (But to be honest, I know I'm not willing to do it because I'm too much of a coward to really go through with surgery that is not absolutely necessary for my survival.) I take the test and discover that I am not a suitable donor for my father because of some uncorrectable defect and the doctor will not accept me.

Here's the question: If I only tell my father about the fact that I'm not a suitable donor, am I a liar, or am I telling the only truth that matters?

There's a legitimate medical reason why I can't do it, so I feel my personal selfish reason is totally moot, and I'm not lying when I say I won't do it because the doctor says it's not safe. I've always wondered if people agree with this thinking, and if not, was I an asshole to take the test to begin with? If so, why should this scenario force me to reveal my dark personal shortcomings?

TL;DR My dad needs a kidney and I won't give mine because I'm a coward. But it turns out I'm not a suitable donor and CAN'T give it anyway. Am I an asshole for just saying I can't and never admitting that I wouldn't if I could?

I said yes. Anyway, going into this relationship I was pretty clear that one of the things I'm most scared of is having a suffocating partner. I made it a point that I need my space but I've been feeling like I have trouble actually getting the point across sometimes. Anyway, in the month leading up to this trip we spent time at our homes far apart, but we were talking to each other every day, probably at a minimum of 2-3 hours spaced out throughout the day. I thought it was a lot sometimes, but everytime I tried to get out of it I felt like I kind of got slithered back in. Anyway, by the end of the month leading up to the trip I was feeling a little worn out. I asked her if we could take the three days before the trip to just not talk. And we agreed that was for the best. The first night she dealt with some issues but the second and third nights she called me again almost looking to pick a fight. We argued about something dumb. Anyway going into the first few days of the trip things seemed alright. We spoke and made up the night she got in. Things got worse though when we actually started trying to snowboard. I had never done it before and so she was gonna show me a few things, although eventually we decided to take a class. During the class, she started to get worn out pretty quick and eventually her legs were hurting, so she ended her lesson an hour early. When I finished my lesson, I was sad that she had to go early but I also felt like she was kind of mad at me for keeping on. The next day we tried actually snowboarding down the small slope next to our cabin. After we got to the bottom, she was tired and in pain (what I assumed to be soreness, although according to her after the fact was far more severe) so she decided to stay back. I asked her if it was alright if I went down the ski-lift once more and she said it was (she meanwhile was going to ask my mother to pick her up from the restaurant at the base of the mountain) , but again I felt like she was mad at me. Anyway, from the house, which you can also access via the slopes she messaged me saying she wasn't able to get in touch with my mom. I went looking around the place we rented and noticed that all of the cars were gone and none of the family was around. I figured she was kind of SOL on getting back, but she's an adult with a wallet and a phone.  Anyway, she got back and started talking about how she felt that I was treating her poorly and never giving her the time of day. But that can't be further from how I feel. Honestly we've been spending pretty much every second together with these few exceptions. She keeps bringing up how she has noone else here, and I know that- but sometimes I feel like she just demands my time. Like she'll fall asleep on my lap and expect me to stay there, and not move, and she'll grumble at me if I do. I'm not trying to be mean to her, and I was certainly not trying to be a dick in general. But I think I'm just getting frustrated with what feels like someone pulling for time I don't feel like I have. She on the other hand feels like she's doing a lot for me and not getting any reciprocation. She mentioned how much her ticket was to come on this trip with us, and she mentioned how she doesn't complain when I smoke (something she initially said attracted her to me) and her feeling was that I don't reciprocate as strongly. And sometimes that might be true. A lot of times she gets irritated at me when I don't say ""I love you"" to her before I go to bed. I know it's stupid to be using that word so early on, but I do honestly feel like a better person sometimes when I'm with her. But she expects me to constantly use it.

They have dated off and on a few times and I've seen him emotionally destroy her. When they took a break he would makeout with other girls around her. (High school btw). And it made her feel like shit. When they got back together, he would tickle and hold hands with another girl (who is his Ex gf) while ignoring my friend. He constantly changes his opinion to fit in which is really irritating. But yesterday I was trying to tell a classmate about how Harriet Tubman was going to be in the $20 dollar bill. I couldn't remember her name and my classmate suggested Susan B Anthony and I said no she isn't black. My friends bf piped up saying ""yes she is"" and I said OK I'll look it up to prove it to you. So I did and when I showed it to him, he said ""whatever, I don't care about black people"". Just like that. No confusion over what he said. When I brought it up to my friend saying I think he's a piece of shit (poor handling, probably makes me the assholes really) she said that he told her he was saying he doesn't care about race. Which is absolutely not what he said. But she said he has a black sister which I didn't know.

After i washed my clothes i was waiting on a dryer. Eventually i got a hold of one. After asking the people if it was theirs, and no one replied that it was, I emptied it. I noticed the clothes were still a bit damp, but i wasn't about to just fill the drier back up and wait for the person to come back since there was multiple other people waiting on the driers, and i had no idea whose clothes these were.

So i put the damp clothes in a basket and off to the side, and loaded up my clothes. After i put my money in, the girl whose clothes they were showed up and got mad at me for unloading it when they were still damp. Am I the asshole?

Should also be noted that this girl was taking up 2 driers.

Edit:
Glad to see this got some attention as I feel it is an important issue.

Couple of facts:
-any time I've been late I've had my clothes moved, I have no qualms with this because it was my fault I was late. (Would you guys be mad if you showed up late to something and your seat you reserved was given away?)
-no one had seen the owner of the clothes for a while (not since they put their clothes in)
-someone else started removing this person's clothes from another drier (she was taking up 2 driers during ultra busy time) and I followed their lead

I have no regrets about not waiting, but I did notice that these clothes were still damp, and maybe I should have given her another minute or two of leeway.


My conclusion: I think she was being a selfish asshole for making us all wait and unload her stuff.  I think that I could have reacted to her asshole behavior more nicely and gave her more of a cushion.  But I was pissed and impatient and so was everyone else in line.  I think she was an asshole and it caused me to respond like an asshole.  I think what I did was fair, but still asshole-ish.

As Gary Gulman would say, ""strict but fair.""  I regret nothing.

Even though you're supposed to ""describe **both sides in detail**"", most people can't help but let their personal bias bleed through. This post is long because I'm trying really hard to be upfront about my natural biases, but there's a quick **TL;DR** at the bottom if you want the basic, bias-crammed AITA.

I'll (31M) dive right into it: I've been living with my girlfriend (29F) for a year and a half now. We argue here and there like any couple, and have been working on our communication, especially when arguing. 

I'm a light sleeper. She's a heavy sleeper. Always have been. Always will be. She has an earlier sleep schedule than me, so I'm normally still awake for a while at night after she goes to bed, and she's normally awake in the morning while I'm still sleeping. 

At night I put on headphones while watching TV after she goes to bed so I don't wake her. She's now telling me that she never asked me to do that, which is true, but I don't want to run the risk of accidentally waking her.

Normally, when she wakes up before me she's pretty quiet, but she's woken me up before, because it just doesn't occur to her that she's being loud enough to wake me. I don't think it ever crosses her brain, because I think she cannot fathom how someone could be awaken so easily. Meanwhile I'm quiet as a mouse while she's asleep, because I can't fathom how noise *wouldn't* wake her up.

Here comes the asshole part. Last night I went to bed around 3am. (Neither of us have anything to wake up for for a couple of days, so fuck it, I'm staying up and sleeping in.) While she was sleeping, I was my usual mouse-like self. However, this morning she woke up at 8am because she couldn't sleep. I was awoken at 8:30am because she was talking to her friend on the phone. 

In her defense, she was speaking quietly, but what little bass she has in her voice still travels through the wall of our one-bedroom apartment. Although I couldn't hear what she was saying, it sounded like Charlie Brown's parents were talking in the living room just on the other side of the wall by my head. I continued to try to sleep but couldn't. 

For the sake of transparency, at this point I'll admit I did a bit of a dick move. I got up and closed the door somewhat loudly to get the point across that she woke me (I didn't slam it, but it was still loud.) I should have said something, but I was clouded by anger and sleepy head. I laid back down in bed for another ten minutes but she kept talking.

I got up again, accepting my fate of little sleep. She was still on the phone as I got dressed and put the leash on the dog. As I went outside to walk the dog, I heard her say something, but I kept walking out. 

I didn't hear her, assuming she was talking to her friend and not me, but again, I'll be transparent and admit that I left in a bit of a huff. Dick move, but part of us working on our communication is taking a moment to calm down before engaging in the argument. I took some deep breaths as I walked my dog, and prepared to talk to her when I got back.

I walk into the apartment and she's gone. I checked the parking lot and her car was gone too. I check my phone for anything from her, but nothing. This raised my anger again, so I was working on a text that told her off, but realized I should take some time to calm down. 

I deleted my text before I even finished it, browsed Reddit for a couple hours, and calmed down. I still hadn't heard from her, so I decided to break the silence. Here's my text verbatim: ""Mornin' babe! Hope you're having a swell day so far! When ya comin' back? Love you! [cute emojis]""

After another half hour or so she calls me back. She's calm, but says, ""What was going on this morning? I hope you weren't mad for me talking to my friend."" I say, ""Well yes, I was upset that you woke me up so early, but I've calmed down now.""

This triggered her. She starts telling me how she's not going to apologize for talking to her friend. I stay quiet because the only thing coming to my mind is blind anger. She continues telling me how she's not in the wrong. Whenever I tried to defend my position, she would interrupt me with her defense before I could finish. 

More transparency: At this point I'm seething because I'm not being heard, so the third or so time she interrupts me, I hang up on her. (Dick move, I know.) She calls back and I ignore it, then send a text saying, ""I'm mad. I need space.""

She sends me a text back telling me that she's mad too and that I was childish for walking out earlier instead of talking to her. 

This begins a text argument. (So much for space, but it's my fault for engaging.) I wont type out the rest of the argument unless someone has questions about it. It's quite long. The broad strokes are that I told her she's disrespecting my sleep when she's on the phone with her friends. She says she won't be a prisoner in my apartment and she can talk to her friends whenever she wants to.

As I typed this up, we agreed to talk about it later today after I've calmed down. Fair enough. 

I'm bringing this to AITA to find out if I'm really treating her like a prisoner because I expect her to send a text to her friends saying something along the lines of, ""Hey my boyfriend is sleeping. We can text or I can call you in a little bit after he wakes up."" But of course, let me know if I'm being an asshole anywhere else during this tale. If anyone has any questions, I'll be open and honest with my answer because I really want to get to the bottom of this.

So I have a lot of siblings on my dads side that I never met or knew as a kid. About 4 years back I met one of my brothers for the first time and we really clicked. We're like the same person and it was really nice to reconnect with a member of that side my family because I never really knew them. So while becoming close with him I became very close with his wife/ my sister in law. She has always been so nice to me. I had my first child last year and she threw me a beautiful shower no cost. She also has her own photography thing she does and she has taken beautiful pictures of my daughter also free of charge. So I have always kinda felt indebted to her. So yesterday she asked me if she could come over or if the next night ( tonight ) would be better. I'm really not good with last minute plans being a new mom and honestly I'm not the best at keeping plans period ( which might be part of what makes me an asshole). So tonight something came up and my mom needed me to come help her with some things. Not thinking I went over there. At this time my sister in law haddent texted me all day and I honestly forgot about our plans. I look at my phone and I have a missed call and a text from her. She had tired to call me an hour prior to tell me she was coming and I didn't answer. Then I read the text and it's her saying she was almost to my house. I apologize and tell her how bad I feel and that I would be more then willing to stop by her house after I left and planed on giving her any gas money she wasted.

(And I'm a boy) Let's call her Stephanie/Steph. Our relationship was pretty average for a different gender relationship. I'd usually tease her about something, she'd tease me back, borderline flirting, but me being in the 6th grade I would've never called it flirting. 

So towards the end of the school year, graduation only a few weeks away, Steph passes me a note in class. We always pass notes, no biggie. To avoid detection of the teacher, I hold off on reading the note for a bit. A few seconds pass and Steph whispers, ""Read it, it's important."" Stealthily as I could, I unfold the note just enough to read what's scribbled on it. 

""Want to go out?""
I quickly close the note back up. I've watched enough Disney Channel to know Highschool relationships never work out, let alone Elementary school relationships. Plus, the idea of a relationship freaked me out/sounded ridiculous at age 12. 

Minutes pass, and we're let go for free time. She immediately confronts me. 
""Did you read it?""
In a tone I usually use to tease her with I quickly reply,
""Y'know what? I'm not gonna read this note.""

so, i've been kicked out of my place, lost my job and now I have to move back in with my parents in my small home town 6 hours away. the same small town that gave me these issues and depression. 

Long story short. 6 months ago, myself, and three others James, Clyde and stacy (all fake names) decided to all move in together in a house. 

We didn't think there would be a problem seeing as three of us (all early 20's guys) had already lived together for a few years/months before this point. and one was close friend

and I will say, The apartment WAS messy. the kind of messy you would expect from 3 20something guys. OF course we did all try to keep it clean and maintained. I remember several times making daily chore lists and delegating tasks for a bi monthly clean up. But alas. we were all messy in our own ways and it never really got better.

Initially there were supposed to be four of us moving in, One for each of the four bedrooms. But james decided to have his girlfriend jenny move in as well. To which we all agreed so long as we split the utilities between all of us. 

later, she became upset because in a heated argument over their own moldy cheese (they were upset that I didn't throw it out for them, because she's allergic to mold. but i've always been taught just to cut the mold off of cheese. and I wasn't aware of her allergy.) I told her that she didn't actually have much say in the household matters because she wasn't paying rent. 

my ""being rude"" to her  has become one of the main reasons that they kicked me out.


before we moved. myself and stacy had a slight argument over what stuff goes where. she essentially said that she intended to bring family and friends over, so she wanted us guys to keep ""our crap"" out of the public areas. for context, all three of us guys are gamers. We all have high end PC's and tv's consoles and etc. 

my issue was that I wasn't happy with my possessions being referred to as ""crap"" and ""junk""

AND we weren't sure what the layout of the house would be.So I didn't want each of us to have to be confined to our rooms because the main living rooms had to be free of our stuff. 

Lo and behold. We found a decent place where we could each get what we had wanted. There was a spacious basement for our ""man cave"" and the mid floor could be kept untouched. 

Unfortunately, Problems kept arising. there were messes, People were leaving things in places. and I feel like there was a lot of unfair double standards being hoisted upon me. for example. a book I left on the coffee table was tossed into my room because it was ""A mess"" while several Ikea magazines were left on the other coffee table since we moved in.

I would be expected to drop whatever I was doing to clean up any inconvenience, while there were several points where I would simply work around other people's messes. 

A turkey roaster and pile of magazines would be left in the corner of the living room and go unnoticed until I put a box of home brewed wine in the same corner. 

or when I leave a couple of dirty dishes at my desk it's an issue. But when one of my roomates has a similar pile in their bedroom, it's never brought up.

getting down to it. My roomates are upset both by the messes, but seemingly moreso of the fact that I would argue that something was a blaring double standard. 


my roomates are upset that ""everything has to be an argument"" 

to that I would say, it wouldn't need to be an argument if everybody was treated with the same standards. 

not to mention that A lot of the so called ""messes"" were in my eyes very minor and over exaggerated.

 http://imgur.com/a/t42UC Here's an example of two of them, and the reactions that followed. 

the first one I admit was me I was up late and made myself some food before going to bed with the plans to wash the dishes in the morning. The crumbs I didn't notice in the dimly lit kitchen. The second one Was blamed on me, though I had been at work in the time it was made,

Those are just the most recent two that I could save before I deleted the group chat, because I was tired of the petty bickering. 

and Clyde for the most part just wants to stay neutral. He moved everything he owns to his room and pretty much never leaves it except for work, because He knows he would be targeted for the same stuff I am.

I'm currently graduated from secondary school and waiting to get into a college. Once I'm in college, I'll get a laptop for school work. There's about 3 months till it starts. 


My (younger) brother took up a part time job recently and used his pay to buy a new computer. He replaced the old computer, which our dad had bought for the two of us to use, and everything that was hooked up to the old computer, keyboard, mouse, printer monitor, was connected to the new one. 


Now, I wouldn't mind using the old computer, but the thing is there are no other monitors, keyboards, mouses, etc in our home and I feel it is unfair I have to fork out money just to use the same computer I've always been using. What's more, there isn't enough space in the house for another computer setup. 


I just want to occasionally use it to play a bit of Overwatch/TF2 from time to time, as well as maybe write a few blog posts. I understand he worked and earned the money to buy the computer and it is completely his, I just want to use it for three months because it is the only computer in our household I can use. 


I have brought it up to our father a couple of times. The first time, my brother agreed to let me use it, but after a few days of complaining about why I logged out from his Steam/Spotify/Facebook, he locked it again. 


I just brought it up to our dad again and after a small argument where my brother insisted the computer belonged to him, my father said he'd pay him the full cost of the computer. He said he didn't want our household to become one where we fought over and refused to share our stuff. If he gave my brother the money for it, then it belonged to him was his logic.

Me: Andy

Guy 1: David

Guy 2: Jacob

So through a mutual friend I met another couple, David and Jacob, (*we are all gay*) at an event two of us were working at a bar (*myself and David *) while his boyfriend Jacob hung out and had some beers while we worked. I don't normally work in the bar but it was a special event to raise money and we were both volunteers.

Anyway, throughout the night David was greeting people and doing his door thing and I was working behind the bar but we would relieve each other when we needed breaks but we talked before and after and we had a ton in common. 

At the same time his Jacob kept coming up and chatting with me and I liked him as well. He had a lot of personality and they both were really nice, smart, around my age and attractive. Jacob pulled me aside at one point and said something along the lines of ""hey, I don't really know how to say this without coming off strange but there is something about you I really like. You are funny, nice and I find you really attractive. You should also know that I told David that about you and we have an agreement that we can play around with other guys if we talk about it. So... just throwing that out there if you are ever interested but if you just want to be friends that is cool too.""

I was flattered and a little surprised because I wasn't expecting that because my mind was more focused on hustling to get drinks out to the partrons so while it was in the back of my head I kept doing my work serving drinks. After we finished they asked me to have some drinks with them so I said ""of course"". At the very least I felt like I could make some new friends and honestly I thought ""hey, maybe these guys both want to have sex with me and what the hell. It could be a lot of fun and I'm single and they are cool with it so why not.""

So we are all having some laughs and fast forward later Jacob gets really strange and he says something like ""I hate myself, I'm so awkward, etc."" and I was kind of surprised because I didn't think that at all. I told him ""no, you are great. I think you are a nice guy and I'm glad we met. Don't say those things about yourself.""

He brightened up but later got strange again and disappeared. I don't know where he went and I asked David ""if he was okay"" and he said he gets strangely moody at times. Jacob comes back and he is fine so I think everything is cool and he was just having a moment. 

Well Jacob disappears again. He smokes a lot so I figured he was just outside having another smoke. At the same time David started bumping into me suggestively and then starts kissing me. So I go with it. 

Jacob comes back and is smiling but then he needs to have some conversation with David so I figure ""um, okay I'll let them talk and if this is not what they want I'll just back off"". They both come back like 5 minutes later and Jacob says to me ""oh David wants to talk to you"". 

Me: ""Um okay, about what?""

Him: ""I don't know he just wants to chat.""

So I follow David into another part of the bar and he is all over me. He is kissing me everywhere and I'm thinking ""this is great, Jacob was smiling earlier, this is probably some setup to invite me back to their place together so I'm going with it.""

After maybe 10 minutes I say to David ""let's get back to Jacob because I feel bad just letting him sit there.""

We get back and he is fucking gone. He took both of our coats which had my house keys, David's house keys, his phone and his money. 

We searched everywhere for him and he just fucking checked out. David starts getting really upset and I don't know what the hell to do. I told him ""hey, let's just get out of here there is a 24 hour coffee place right down the street I'll get you a coffee to help sober you up and we can figure out what they hell we are going to do."" 

This all really fucking sucks by the way because it is winter and neither one of us have coats, keys and like I said he didn't have his money or phone. 

We get coffee and he really starts crying. He tells me their relationship is falling apart and he doesn't know what to do and is just sobbing. Like sobbing so hard I haven't heard anyone sob in years. 

So I'm there and I really don't know what the hell I'm going to do. My landlord doesn't do afterhour lockouts. It's like 4:00 in the morning. I don't know who to call (*normally I'd call and crash at a friends place and get new keys later or in this case hopefully my jacket back which already had my keys*) but David doesn't want to go home and I don't want to leave the guy sobbing on the street. 

So I put us in a cab and I go to a hotel near my house. I got one with two rooms so he knew without a doubt that I wasn't trying to get in his pants anymore and I just wanted to make sure he was okay. We get there and check in and he is still sobbing his heart out so I just let him talk and listen. 

I encourage him to take a shower or bath (*one to get him to sober up a little more*) and two I know that a warm shower always makes me feel better when I'm sad. 

I hang out on the hotel balcony, fuck around with the TV and try and give him some time. I can hear him fucking wailing and sobbing in the bath so after like 10 minutes of this I go and quietly knock on the door and ask if he is okay and wants to talk anymore. He asks me to come in so I sit on the floor next to him and just let him talk. 

After ahwhile he cheers up a bit and then he starts kissing on me again and I kissed back start rubbing his chest and then I just said ""stop, we can't do this. I can't do this. You are really vulernable right now and I can tell you are hurting. This is not going to make you feel better and I can't have sex with you or anything because I just can't take advantage of this situation when you are feeling so sensastive.""

I put him to bed and we wants me to lay with him so we shared the bed and I just laid there and let him talk and rubbed his head and comforted him until he was soon fast asleep and snoring. 

We wake up this morning and I hear him in the bathroom crying again. 

I felt awful. At the same time I'm thinking ""where in the fuck is his BF? Why did he take my fucking coat and basically lock me out of my house and also screw David by leaving him with no money, no keys and no phone?""

I feel like I some how read everything wrong at the bar and just walked into some bad situation and somehow fucked up their relationship. 

Frankly I didn't know what the hell to do and yes we kissed and rubbed against each others bodies but I stopped it because it just didn't feel right. 

This morning I got him a coffee and walked him home (*fucking cold as hell - again no coats*) and feeling like I just didn't want to even talk to anyone I went and broke into my own house. Fuck it... I'll deal with that later. 

But now I've been sitting here for 2 hours feeling like a real asshole and I fucked the whole situation up somehow.  

**tl;dr: Two guys who were into me (*and a couple*) invited me for drinks and suggested at sex then shit got weird. His BF freaked out and ditched us with no coats or keys, phone, etc. and I spent half the night comforting his BF at a hotel because I didn't know what else the fuck to do since I couldn't get in my house and he didn't want to go home. Now I feel like I fucked everything up.**

Calling me a hoe  telling me her and her "" man "" had been together for ten years. Couldn't understand much else through the hysterical screaming other then she said I was "" waisting my time and my....pussy?

We had a spare room and didn't really need to rent but I knew she'd just changed jobs so couldn't afford much, plus I thought it would be nice to have her around and we'd be helping her out rent wise.

The apartment is brand new and costed quite a bit (my bf owns it) and shortly after she moved in I got annoyed because she didn't seem to be as conscious or careful/caring of the property as I/we would have liked her to have been (or as much as we are). 

She's not messy at all - but it was the little things that added up like: 1) breaking a mug and didn't tell us or offer to replace (we wouldn't have minded but an offer to telling us as a min. would have been appreciated) 2) she roasted a chicken (totally okay) but didn't use any foil and grease splattered all over the inside of the oven, she said she would clean but then didn't and then got upset later when we asked if she could please use foil because ""ovens aren't meant to be cleaned"" 3) leaves minor chocolate stains on the couch, she probably doesn't notice because they are small but I end up dabbing to them out

Now she's a great flatmate, always wants to cook for us or her friends, chatty and actually really clean compared to a lot of people. But I got a bit OCD/paranoid from things like the examples above, and instead of confronting her I just started to clean around her (like sweep the laundry after she left a bit of powder on the floor or clean out the laundry when she left a clump of solidified powder in there). 

Yesterday we both finally reached our limit and argued about it and she said that she doesn't feel like it's her home and she's stressed all the time because I'm cleaning after/around her and she doesn't think she's messy at all. She's always trying to make sure things are clean more than normal now and I've been basically awful to make her feel like that. Also we do have a weekly cleaner and she doesn't understand why she needs to be super clean if we pay someone to come around (okay, I get that)

I agreed maybe I can tune back the OCD. But she feels like she has an equal share to the flat because she does pay rent. But ultimately I feel like my bf owns the flat and we should be grateful we pay so little rent and repay the gratefulness by making sure everything is really well looked after. 

I hate that I've turned into ""that"" kind of ""landlord"" to live with (I get that I don't even own the house but trying to manage my bfs feelings of his property) and I am ashamed some of the things I've resented her for are a bit petty.

I've always been sort of the shoulder to cry on (deep in friend zone) guy to Jen.  I've had a massive crush on her the entire time I've known her but because a friend of mine broke the ""bro code"" and dated her (but that's a different story I have never tried anything with her.  
Okay I have always helped her out through all of her problems including ones related to her former boyfriend.  Which I didn't really mind because we were and are close friends.

Until it has grown to a point where she admitted she wants to have something with And despite admitting this she will not give me a shot.  But the thing that has been slowly kinda bothering me is she still expects me to do all the ""couple things"" like hold her hand, squeeze her leg, put my arm around her, hug her for a long time etc.  So this is began to annoy me because I can feel myself slipping deeper into that friend zone I've been in for so long despite my best attempts.  
This all boiled down until a few days ago when I finally asked her out and told her how I felt about doing the ""couple things"" which resulted in me lashing out a bit after she said that she still wants to do all of these things but she won't have anything with me right now.  With her explanations being she is scared of her ex, she is scared of what her mom will think and she's scared she'll lose me.

I just have a much stronger preference towards neatly trimmed pubic hair as opposed to having a bush down there. That said, I never felt like it was my place to bring it up – after all, it’s his body, and he’s welcome to do as he pleases with it.

My boyfriend lives about two hours away from me, so during the week we primarily communicate through Skype. Last night, however, I got a little drunk with my roommates and was a few glasses of wine in before we had our skype call. I don’t know exactly how it came up in conversation – I think he was actually talking about his body hair – but I made a tactfully-worded comment along the lines of “Y’know, I’d be curious to see how it would look if you trimmed up your pubic hair a bit, just out of curiosity. I’d bet it would look good on you”.

He seemed a bit taken back by my comment. He asked me if I think he should shave off all his other body hair as well, which I said no to – I like his body hair, I just wished that he’d trim his pubic hair just a tad. He said that he’d never trimmed his pubic hair before, and that he might try it. But I could tell that it was something he’d never given much thought to.

The rest of our skype conversation was great, but now I can’t help but to feel that I made him feel insecure about his body. I don’t want him to think that he isn’t good enough or that I don’t accept him as he is, that isn’t true at all, I just thought he would look good trimmed up. He’s not expressed that he’s upset to me or anything, and I think I’m probably just overthinking it and he probably just saw it as a random comment in the midst of a longer conversation, but looking back on my comment I feel bad for having made it, especially since I wouldn’t have made it sober unless we had been together for a lot longer than a month.

As a continuation from this. For context of anybody needs it. 

My roommates have kicked me out, and are still living in the house. 

They are bringing in another of their friends to take my place. 

And because of the way the damage deposit is. They won't get it until they all move out. 

I feel it's unfair to me that my part of the damage deposit be used to give this new person a free ride. So I asked that they charge this new person for at least 3/4 of my part of the damage deposit. And buy out my part essentially. 

They say that this is unfair to the new person as according to them there are already enough damages that we wouldn't get anything back. This is in the forms of two chips in the already warped and chipped counter. And a spot of paint(paint remover that I painted over to keep it from further rusting)  on the dryer. 

I say three things in response.

1. The landlord's have already replaced the refrigerator, the dishwasher, and the oven, without concern. 

(I fixed the handle on the old oven whicj was the only issue and the landlord's preferred to keep it and the put the new second hand oven in storage just in case.)

2. Every appliance in the house is second hand.  

3. There's no way we've done $2000 of damage to the house in the past six months. 

4. There is another set of working washer and dryer sitting in the laundry room unused for that exact purpose.

They didn't include that there are 6 people currently living there and one extra who's been staying on our couch because of a bad breakup. 

One extra shower isn't going to jack up the utilities any more than an extra person living there. IMHO.

I am an aspiring musician, and I often come here to do some research personally for my self development as a person and for my music. Due to being a broke ass bitch, I don't have money for headphones at the moment. So, I have to listen to my music off the CPU's built in speakers, which can carry a little bit if it's relatively quiet but not by any means clear or boisterous and I always try to keep it at about half for the sake of others. Not loud enough to put vocals down or anything but enough to catch the gist of track and get my creative juices going. But, there's this guy who for all intensive purposes call him Tom. 

Every time Tom walks into the computer, I sigh a breath of impending aggrevation to myself. He has an affinity to only use one computer (Background Info. Digression: the shelter is pretty run down, but in comparison to the other options in town its the ""Taj Mahal"" of homeless shelters), anyway, the computer room has bedbugs. (Some Taj Mahal, js.) I know someone has seen the a bed bug in the chair on the left side of the two man station where the computers are situated. 

So Tom tends to lean toward the left side of the computer station. {Which seems ridiculous to me, since the bedbugs are just going to stay to one side of the room when the whole shelter has them}. If someone happens to be on the right side of the station when I arrive, and leaves before Tom does, or right as Tom does. Her will wait, and for me to get off the right side of the computer even though there is a completely and equally infested computer right across from me. He tells me that he saves his files on the computer on the right side. But the computers are wiped daily at two in the morning. (shelter doesn't want people saving on the computers). So I doubt that is the reason. In any event he argues that for some inexplicable reason it saves his files on this computer. 

But the real kicker is that he plugs his LOUD speaker to the CPU, and blasts his music or listens to news and conspiracy theories for HOURS at a time with no consideration of anyone else at all. If I turn the computer up to a 100 percent I can't even hear my music, and if I could it's a conflict of ODDISEE and Issa Gold from my side and Stevie Wonder and The Whispers and various country artists and Alex Jones that swell into this ear bleeding cacophony of soulful hell. 

I can't get any work done with this, and unfortunately I don't have an ID (lost my wallet) so I can't just escape and go to the library to escape. No phone either. Life is pretty ass atm, but I know it will pick up again. But, what I don't know is the bigger asshole in this situation? Him or I? Should I ask him to turn it down? He's a pretty bitter, admittedly negative, and just overall surly. I feel like he's just seeking attention, and if I ask him to turn it turn he's just getting the attention he wants (negative or positive). I don't know. Reddit, help a brother out please ??

We are both college freshman who were in a relationship for 2.5 years before we got to college. The first semester was rough, she danced and grinded on one of her guy friends, and she was drinking more than ever (which is expected, it got annoying though). I broke up with her over Thanksgiving break. I felt terrible a few days after because I didn't really even give her a chance to fix things. She knew I was having problems, but I blindsided her, so I asked if she wanted to try again.

Fast forward to Winter Break. Things are still a little shakey, so I offer her two options: we can try again, or we can take a break and see if this is what we really want. She chose the second option, and I was fine with that. 

We agreed to keep in contact but not as much, and we would be allowed to do stuff with other people aside from oral or sex. I try texting her the first whole week, but she keeps blowing me off until last Thursday. She calls me and asks to break up. I asked her if this had to do with her friend that she grinded on (how I was suspicious of for a long time), and she said yes. 

I was sad to break up but devastated that it was because of him. I text her a few days after for a better explanation, and I find out that two days after she broke up with me, she had sex with him. It took us 2.5 years to have sex.

I'm absolutely furious, and she says that I have no right to judge her and she wants to be friends. I can't even look at her the same way.

Our rules state that no resident may park in a way that could impede another from exiting/entering their residence. Everyone tries to be courteous but we only have one car spot in the 2 car garage (since our washer and dryers and water heater are located in the garage and state law says a barrier to prevent a car hitting the any of that must be in place before a car may be parked on that side of the garage). We also have a parking lot of 11 spaces for 12 units that is always packed. 



So this all started the day my boyfriend and I moved into our new house.  Now, I grew up in the South and maybe things are different in other places, but generally you welcome new neighbors to the neighborhood. We bought a house in California and day one, while we're moving in, our neighbor comes over and tells us not to park in the left spot in front of our garage because she has trouble pulling out of her garage if a car is there as the houses sit perpendicular to eachother. No hello, no introduction, no welcome to the neighborhood, just ""Don't park there.""  Okay....nice to meet you too.



Of course, I don't want to make a stir, because I'm not one to cause a scene so I just smile and ensure her we'll make sure not to park there.  And we don't. It's super inconvenient for us because at the time we had three cars so one goes in the garage, one on the right side of the drive and the third just has to hope there's a spot open in the parking lot. 



We've lived here for over a year now. Twice a car was parked there out of necessity (my boyfriend) because there were no spots available.  The first time, she came over and asked that we move the car. And I moved it for her right then and appologized. The second, much later, I left the house to get the mail and she is standing there waiting and starts yelling at me about needing to leave her house and having to wait on me. Apparently she had rung our doorbell, which had broken a week prior so I had no idea she was waiting for me to move my car. Why she didn't knock, I have no idea. I have dogs and they would have barked a few times if someone knocked so I know she didn't. My boyfriend had moved my car to do some work in the garage and forgot to tell me so I had no idea there was a car in her way. Her attitude was passing me off but I again apologized and moved the car for her, very politely.



Now I want also add that this lady leaves her house maybe once a month and a car in our drive does not block her from backing out of her garage. You would have to cut the wheel pretty far but it by no means blocks anyone in. So the fact that she sat out there stewing and getting mad at me about it is pretty ridiculous to me. Especially since she stayed mad at me once I explained the doorbell didn't work.   



A WHOLE YEAR LATER, a friend needed a new place on short notice because of a bad roommate. We have a spare room and decided to rent it out to him. He has one car. So now we have four cars in a neighborhood that is quickly running out of parking spaces as a lot of other people in the community are buying new cars. I get a knock on my door. It's the neighbor. Unbeknownst to me, my roommate has parked in the forbidden spot because there were no other spots available in the community. She puts up a huge fuss about it, I apologize and go wake up my roommate, who works nights, (it's 11am at this point) and he moves his car to a red curb so she can get out. She didn't leave for another hour or two so he had to stay up until she left so he could put his car back into a legal spot. 


I have to stress that we've parked in that spot now 3 times in almost 2 years and somehow, I am always the one getting bitched at by this lady even though I am never the one to park there and she knows this. She's incredibly rude about it every time, cutting me off when I apologize and lecturing me as if we do this on a daily basis and acts like we're parking directly behind her car when in reality, she could pull out without us moving.  



The night before last, my roommate parked there again. He gets home at 3am and there were no other spots. It was pouring raining and it's basically a crap shoot as to whether this lady will leave her house tomorrow or not so he parked on the left side of the drive. I have no idea about it.  The next day, there's a knock on my door. Guess who?  She starts yelling immediately.  ""Whose car is that?!"" I got about as far as, ""Oh, I'm sorry, Matt works nights, he's slee..."" before she cuts me off ""Go get him! I don't care if he's sleeping, I want to talk to him.""  Now, I'm a polite person and I don't like confrontation but I'm not going to be yelled at on my doorstep and have demands made of me. So I slammed to door in her face and went back to what I was doing. She yelled through the door that she would call the police and she wanted that car moved now. Matt slept until 3pm and then got up for work. I didn't wake him up to move his car. He texted me later to let me know that she yelled at him too when he left about having his car towed. 



 Was I wrong here? I don't mind not parking there even though it's a pain in the ass and I certainly don't mind moving my car for her since I'd told her we would avoid parking there but her attitude is always shitty, and I'm just trying to be polite and fix the situation. I guess this time I was just tired of being yelled at.",AITA for slamming the door in my neighbor's face?,0.94,-inf,,,

My boyfriend has a habit of leaving his deodorant on the counter instead of in the bathroom. I asked him if he could leave it in the bathroom and he said he likes it on the counter.

He then told me to put my purse and pictures and decorations on my desk instead of the counter if that's how I felt about it. I told him it's not because it's his item but because it's something that gets spread on his armpits so it's more a sanitary thing that just having stuff lying around. 

So tell me, am I the asshole for asking him not to leave his deodorant on the counter?

I honestly don't think she heard me, but we were talking about a friend at the time and she asks for me to text his number to her. I say yeah, and then repeat can she just take a step back because she smelled of smoke. Melody says that she will take a step away if I just text her the number. I get peeved right then because I have asked twice and I tell her I will send her the number if she takes a step or two back. She says I'm being mean and doesn't understand why I can't give it to her right then. I say I don't understand why she can't take a step back anyway, because I'm texting her the number, it's not like I have to physically hand it to her. Melody says that if I had just given her the number to begin with she would've walked away. I tell her that was unlikely since 1) we were in the middle of a conversation and we only knew each other there and 2) she wasn't going to call him, she hates talking on the phone and it was 11 at night, he's probably sleeping. The most she was going to do was text him. She says nothing to this and we're both obviously annoyed and she still refuses to move away so I put my phone back in my pocket. She vows to follow me around for the rest of the night. There's literally like thirty seconds of silence between us before our other friend, Brant, comes and notices the tension, and Melody immediately tells him that we had a fight because ""FeonixPheathers is being a douchebag and won't give me So&So's number because he says I smell like smoke."" Brant doesn't even listen for my side, but for the rest of the night they call me a douchebag and make jokes that people shouldn't smoke near me since I'm a cigarette nazi.

Honestly, we made up like a minute after that altercation, but it's been eating at me because she said I was being rude by asking her to step away. Was I the asshole?

EDIT: In fairness, I would have stepped a way myself, but I was sitting down in a crowded bar when she came in and she was standing which is why I didn't think it was a big deal for her to just take a step back.

He had warned me previously that the dog will sometimes deliberately slip his collar and make a run for it. I try to be mindful of this whenever I walk him.

After the dog had done his business, I was encouraging him back up the apartment stairs when he stood and looked at me for a second. Then he jerked his head, popping his collar off, and took off like a bullet.
Without knowing what to do and afraid we'd never find him if I lost sight of him, I bolted after the dog. I chased him for blocks and blocks through the suburbs, cutting through peoples' backyards, through fields, through the bad part of the neighborhood, and finally edging onto the main roads. The dog avoided me like his life depended on it, and I lost sight of him multiple times but kept going. At one point a woman gave me a ride in her car to catch up with him.

Eventually, the dog made a mistake, and I was able to catch him in a fenced-in garden.
I have asthma, and I was red in the face and in pretty bad shape by this time, still wearing my winter jacket. The dog was frothing at the mouth from exertion.

Getting back was its own ordeal. I didn't know where I was and had to stop and ask for directions back home.

Eventually, I made it back to the apartment. A five-minute pee break had taken something like 45 minutes to an hour. I thought my boyfriend might be out looking for us by this point.

When I got inside, he was still where I'd left him, sitting on the couch watching TV. Winded, I dramatically recanted the adventure I had just been on. I took my jacket off and jokingly threw it at him (I apologized for this later). I was a little irritable and put-out from all the effort, but not angry. I was looking for some kind of sign of appreciation from my boyfriend for going to (what I felt) was a big effort to get his dog home safe. 
Instead, he reminded me that he had warned me that the dog could slip his collar. He seemed annoyed with me. 

We got into a fight. He told me that when I choose to walk the dog, he is MY responsibility, and chasing him down was the right thing to do, not something I should expect a thank you for. He called me vain and said I was acting entitled.

I brought them to my father's house and shared with him these coffees. I told him to freely take them whenever he wanted a coffee. At the end, we consumed half of the Ethiopian and the Yemenese (he didn't like the Vietnamese).

The day I left, my father was going to take me by car to where I currently live. Before we left, he asked: ""Hey, can you give me some coffee?"". I said yes, and as I was proceeding to gave him half of the Ethiopian coffee (his favourite) when he insisted that I should give him the whole package. I told him that I had shared with him all the coffee during all the days we were together, and that the coffee is actually a present from my mom, who intended that I enjoyed it. I don't mind sharing, but giving it away just seemed wrong to me. He told me that that was miserable, mean, niggard; and that he is my father.

I tried to take it in stride and have. I read online that the best way to get over being rejected by a friend is to spend less time with them. Either they will realize that they actually do like you or you can get over them. 

So I told her ""I really like you which is why I'm gonna have to pull back for a while. I hope you understand."" 

She replied with ""What do you mean by pull back?"" 

I said "" Like not hang out with you as much."" 

She said ""okay :////"" 

After that I went to bed and I thought it was fine. At around midnight, I woke up and I had a snap from her that was just black with the text ""I just don't want to lose my best friend"" and I started to feel really bad. So, my question is, should I just give up and continue trying to be her friend in the same way? Or should I continue trying to distance myself from her in an effort to get over her? Also AITA? And do you think she's trying to manipulate me?

Edit: I asked if she was trying to manipulate me because she doesn't usually act like this. She's more of the one word text repsonse kind of gal.

Edit: I decided that I was being an asshole for ascribing malicious intent to her not being attracted to me. I told her ""Even though, it may take me a lot longer to get over you, I've decided that I'm not going to not be friends with you because I really value your friendship."" I value the friendship even more than I necessarily value my feelings. And I was being kind of dramatic. It's not really even an infatuation or love I have for her. It was more of a crush. I can easily get over her while still being able to stay ""besties"" with her. I think I'm just gonna stop going out of my way for her now which would probably make both of us more comfortable anyway. She told me it was really mean and she felt sad when I said that. I told her that I'm sorry and that was that I guess. Thanks for all of your help and opinions. 

Last edit: Apparently she cried when I told her that I wanted to pull back so I do think I made the right decision here. I doubt she's trying to mainpulate me.

The conversation went a little something like this 

Me: I want you to know that I really value your friendship and appreciate you and you told me that a few weeks ago and I just realized that I've never really told you that so yeah

Her: Yeah I'm really glad you decided to not to stay away because when you said that I got really sad and cried.

Me: I'm sorry. I couldn't stay away from *insert her pet name here*

This past weekend we were at a big competition with probably 20 other dance teams, and it was at a convention center. There was about three hours between the time my youngest daughter's team and my oldest daughter's team would go on, so we walked around the convention center and got some food to kill time.

While we were sitting on the bleachers eating our food, a man came up to us and told us that a girl on his dance team had just lost her mother in an accident two months ago, and that I looked like her to a tee. He showed me a picture on his phone, and I do have to admit I look a lot like this woman. He told me that she had seen me multiple times throughout the day and each time got upset because she thought I was her mom. I didn't really know what to say so I just said 'that's terrible, I'm so sorry for her loss'.

Then he said that as 'one dance parent to another' he would appreciate it if I would leave, because my presence was too upsetting to the girl on his team and he wanted to be sensitive to her feelings. I was taken aback and just told him that I was waiting for my 12-year-old's team to go on and I couldn't just leave because then no one would be supervising my 9-year-old. He shrugged his shoulders and said 'I hoped you would do the right thing, I suppose I'll have to go talk to the event organizers'.

I was still in shock and my oldest daughter told me we should tell her coach what happened, so we did, because my daughter thought maybe he was trying to somehow sabotage her team? We pointed him out and my daughter's coach said he wasn't the coach of a team they were competing against and not to worry about it, if anyone said anything else he'd deal with them.

No 'event organizer' ever came up and asked me to leave, but word got around within the parents of our team, and most parents thought the guy was way out of line but a couple have suggested that maybe I should have just stayed out of the way so the girl on the other team wouldn't have to see me, and that it would have been kinder to do so. A few parents even said that they wouldn't have minded watching my 9-year-old while I waited out in the car. 

I'm just wondering if I was insensitive to this girl in any way, or if that guy's request was out of line. I thought it was, but if the girl just lost her mom then I wouldn't want to be insensitive.

So like my friends I work and I study, and my friends which study with me are now pissed at me because the following events took place:

In December we had a paper to turn in, and since one of them was a father recently (Let's call him Joe) and the other one is going trough a hard time (Let's call him Pete), I started doing the paper about 2 weeks before the time ends. I'd do one page, or one paragraph and send it to them by e-mail for them to see what was being made. Anyway this keeps going until Joe tells me by e-mail that I was being an individualist by doing all that by myself, and I was somewhat hurt by that because my intentions were to help them since we have so little time (work and school). I said it was not my intention, I just wanted to get work done since I knew they had less time then I did. Anyway, I stopped working on the paper since I already did so much, and I waited for them to turn something over. But days passed and nothing was done, and they even had time to plan a dinner both of them and their wives. So the day before the deadline at about 8pm they send me their parts for me to put everything together and work on the rest of my part.
I did it, but I also sent an e-mail ranting about what happened, since we talked about making everything with time as it should be and not do everything in the last hour as it happened. I also said again that I started doing the paper soon to avoid this, and that the dinner that they both had could wait one more week because the paper had a deadline, the dinner didn't.
Joe got pretty pissed at me because of what I said, and so did Pete.


This time has passed and things are now awkward because Joe still insists that I had no right in saying what I did, and I am starting to feel pretty bad... But I think true friends should share the good and the bad and I think it's what I did. Maybe I am just a freakin asshole... :| thoughts?

There are eight of us all together, and sometimes things can get a little chaotic. The game was pretty exciting and during a big part of an encounter another player and I took a turn together. The GM went next, and did something that incapacitated the female player's character. 

She was, rightfully so, not happy about it because had tried to act earlier but was talked over by me and the other players. She made her disappointment known multiple times as she tried to figure out what she could do with limited ability. I apologized, several times, and agreed that it was wrong that we had talked over her. 

Then I turned to the person running the game and asked if we could spend a valuable resource to allow her to have her turn the way she wanted to take it before we rudely talked over her. Her response was,""No, you need to live with your mistake. The lesson here is that women's voices are softer and you need to be more mindful of that in these situations.""

I believe that I had made a sincere effort to apologize, take blame, and try to make it right. I was pretty hurt that she rejected my efforts to apologize. I was even angry that she turned it around onto me specifically when others were to blame but stayed quiet. 

I know that I am the asshole for talking over her, but I just can't seem to let her response to my apology go and feel so angry about it. AITH for being angry at her? Should I let her know how I feel about this whole thing?

I'm 22F.  I was friends for a while with this guy who's in his early forties.  I know, I know.  He started talking to me while I was in high school.  I didn't want to judge a book by its cover, even though my dad repeatedly warned me about him.

Anyway.

I know this guy likes to date young girls, but he never expressed any interest in me.  He always told me he looked at me like a friend and I said the same.  Because I DID see him like a friend and nothing more.  Sometimes he and I would make dumb sex jokes, but he does that with all his friends, and I do that with all of mine.  It was clear to me they were nothing but jokes, especially considering I had a bf at the time and he was way hung up on his ex of like... four years now?  Almost five?

To continue.

Once my long-term boyfriend and I broke up, he immediately started acting different.  Getting mad if I ""talked to guys my own age,"" that kind of stuff.  Getting mad if I didn't text him every day. Getting really possessive.  I asked him if he liked me, he said no.  He kept getting more aggressive in his behavior, and eventually I asked him again and he admitted that he did.  When I explained that I didn't have feelings for him like that, he told me I was ""lying to myself about my feelings"" and that he'd ""never been wrong about a girl liking him before.""

Okay.  Well, he wanted to remain friends but needed some space.  Okay.  I gave him some space, didn't text him every day.  And then he went off on me with a passive-aggressive text about how I wasn't being a good friend because I wasn't talking to him enough.

I couldn't handle it anymore so I decided to cut contact.  I figured that eventually he'd calm down and maybe we could talk things out, but clearly talking hadn't worked at that point so I might as well wait.  I blocked him on Facebook and my phone because he was pretty obsessive with the way he contacted his ex and I didn't want him to do that to me.

When he figured out I'd blocked him, he started following me around online on sites that didn't have a blocking function.  Making fun of my previous suicide attempt on public forums.  He's also been making sexual comments about me, especially about my breasts.

Today he and I finally had a blowup fight.  He was harassing me publicly - again - so I told him he needed to leave me alone.  See, nobody on this site knew that he had confessed to me, as he asked me not to tell anyone.  The only people who knew were people close to me that I'd told.  And, as I know now, the people he told.  I told him publicly that if he didn't leave me alone, I'd make the details of our last few conversations public.

He blew up and started making comments about how I'd led him on, forced him to confess even though he only liked me because he was depressed and he was already getting over it at the time, how I'd ended our friendship in a shxtty way and how he makes fun of everyone so I wasn't allowed to be mad that he was making fun of me.

The majority of the site came to support me - many of them sent me private messages.  About three or four girls have had to leave the site because of his behavior towards them.  One girl defended him, but that's about it.  I assume he's never made advances at her because, as he told me, he only dates girls that are basically in high school/college.

I've been talking to his ex and getting her side of the story about the breakup.  How he posted her nudes online for revenge and sent them to her friends, how he got multiple phone numbers when she blocked his, how he went to her home town to force her to speak with him after she blocked him, how they had sex when she was underage.  All that stuff.

To be honest, I'm feeling pretty good about how I handled things, if a bit stressed.  He complained that I didn't talk to him privately - however, he's really manipulative and he can be really, really nasty when confronted, and I didn't feel comfortable opening the avenue for him to talk to me personally.  I felt like this was a fair response to him not leaving me alone.

Am I crazy?  Am I a prick for telling him his behavior is inappropriate and he needs to leave me alone?

  My best friend (we'll call him Jared), myself, and a friend of ours (lets call him Carl) all lived in a 3br condo. For the first few months that Carl was living with Jared and me, he slept in the living room (waiting for the remaining tenant from the lease before ours to move out).  Once said tenant moved out, Carl moved into a bedroom.  Fast forward about 5 months.  Jared tells me that his mother is having trouble paying her rent (which isn't uncommon, she's been financially irresponsible for as long as I can remember), and he wants to move her and his little brother into the condo.  He asks if, with enough time, Carl and I would be okay moving out and finding another place.  I am absolutely fine with this, as Jared and his family have let me rent a room from them when I was much younger and got kicked out of my parents house.  I told him it wasn't as issue, and Carl and I began entertaining the idea of finding another place to live.  
  A few weeks later, Jared let me know that he had talked to the landlord, and the landlord was not okay with Jared moving his family in and Carl and I moving out. Upon hearing this news, Jared informed me that he would be moving out of the condo and into an apartment with his mother and brother.  About 2 weeks later, on a Friday, Jared lets me know, in passing, that his mother and brother will be moving into our living room this weekend. I was a little taken back by the abruptness of it all, but I gathered my composure and asked Jared, ""For how long?"". Jared just shrugs his shoulders and tells me, ""I don't know"", and carries on with what he was doing. 
  It is discussed between Jared and Carl and I that his mother would not be paying rent, but instead she would be paying for the internet bill (no more than $50/mo I would imagine).  I wasn't too fond of the idea, but if I were to voice that opinion I'd be considered an asshole by Jared, as his mother is ""moving in so she can save money to find her own place"".  So, Jared's mother and little brother move in.  And having lived with his mother before, I knew how unclean and disorganized of a person she is. I'm talking old dirty dishes piled up for a month, dogs peeing/pooping in the house and it not getting cleaned up, trash littered all throughout the house, not cleaning up after herself, etc.  I would also consider her to be an enabler, and a bit of a hoarder, though I don't really know if that's relevant to this story.  About 2 months go by, and our landlord wants us to start paying utilities (he paid them prior).  I tell Jared that I think that we should split the utilities 5 ways since there's 5 people living there (Myself, Jared, Carl, Jared's little brother [age 14], and Jared's mother).  This greatly upsets Jared, and he tells me I'm an asshole for wanting to charge his 14 year old brother utilities.  I explain to him that whether he lived in our condo or in an apartment with just he and his mother like before, his mother was responsible for paying his utility usage.  Just because he's not old enough to pay the utilities himself, doesn't mean that he doesn't use them.  He plays video games, showers, uses the A/C, etc all of which require electricity, water, and gas.  I ultimately decided that splitting them 4 ways was the only way to keep negligible amount of peace in the house, so that's what we ended up doing.  
  I still feel like the utilities should have been split 5 ways, and I tried asking family for unbiased opinions but they sided with me and I'm not sure if it's just because we're all so like-minded or if I'm really not the asshole.  For what it's worth, we have all gone our separate ways and Jared and I have not spoken since the conversation of the utilities (though his mother and I were cordial whilst living together).  It's extremely awkward living in a 1,200 sq. ft. condo with someone and not speaking to them for 10 months.  This may as well be unrelated to *my* situation, but Jared and his family still owe the landlord about $2,500 from not having paid their rent every month. Carl and I now live with the landlord at his home and have remained friends.  There is literally sooo much more that goes into this story that I feel would help my case, but I want to keep it as concise as possible.  I'm sure I'm forgetting some things.

This event would be followed by a mandatory staff meeting of my department. I don't own any superhero shirts, so I didn't think I would go, but on Wednesday, I heard the manager talking to someone else about his impressive collection of superhero shirts. I was intrigued, and asked him nicely then and there if he was willing to lend me one of his shirts, since we took the same size. He said he was happy too, and we agreed that he would bring it on the day of, I would wear it over top of the shirt I came in for a few hours, and then give it back to him before the meeting started. The whole interaction was very positive.

Now we'll skip ahead to Saturday night, or more accurately, 1 AM on Sunday morning. I hadn't spoken about the event to this manager since Wednesday, and I had last been at work on Thursday, so I knew a confirmation message was called for. I was still a little unsure until about exactly that time, though, so I decided to message him on Facebook right away. I texted, and I quote ""I'll be coming to the superhero party tomorrow, so please bring a shirt for me! Thanks"". Not the most formal interaction, I admit, but I thought that because it had already discussed, I didn't need to go through all the formalities, and that doing so again might even be strange. I didn't think he'd be awake to see it, but I knew he only lived a block away from work, and that he would have his bag with him anyways, so it should be no trouble.

Anyways, I went to bed and then woke up at 9:45. I saw there was a text from 8:15 that just read ""Are you kidding me?"" This is a somewhat ambiguous message that does lean towards the negative, but I decided not to respond. I should also mention that I largely do not communicate with this manager online, only face to face, and thus did not know their online mannerisms, making me more unsure about how to interpret this message.

Anyways, I arrive at the office about 20 minutes before the event starts. A fair amount of people are already there, including the manager. I say hi, and he almost immediately begins chewing me out in front of multiple other staff members. He said he did not appreciate being asked at 1 AM for a shirt of his, and he did not appreciate my ""tone."" He even said he hoped I had been drunk and it had impaired my judgement, to which I stretched the truth and said I had been--in reality, I had had a couple of drinks, but I had felt fairly sober and said basically the same thing I would have otherwise. I tried to probe a little to exactly what part of it upset him, and it seemed to strictly be the time that I sent it at. He made it out to seem like not enough notice at all. I asked him if he remembered our conversation on Wednesday, and he said he did, but that texting him at 1 in the morning was just not right. It hadn't woken him up or anything, but it struck the wrong chord with him. His whole argument seemed rather silly to me, but I knew I shouldn't press, so I acquiesced.

He then immediately switched to a cheery demeanour and took me to his bag, where he showed me 3 or 4 other shirts, which I knew made up most of his collection. I picked the one I liked the most, he happily gave it to me, and he went to another part of the office.

The event went fine. I didn't talk to him much during it, but I could see that he had worn his coolest shirt, and that he was getting more compliments on his than I was mine, which I was totally fine with. At the end of the event, I went up to him and gave him back his shirt. There was again no hint of animosity, and he simply asked if I had had a good time and if people had liked my shirt. He then told me some of the compliments he got on his. He left shortly after, since he wasn't part of my department.

So, Reddit, is his behaviour justified considering all the circumstances? How do you suggest I not upset him if another event like this one happens in the future and I need his help again?

For whatever reason most of my family doesn't understand this, they see it as I'm home all day so I should be available anytime to do whatever.  
For the last year or so my grandma hasn't been taking care of herself, she's in her 90s and lives alone and no one in the family has any kind of power of attorney or legal ability to medically sign for her. She's been falling a lot, not eating, and staying in bed all day and is basically starving herself to death slowly. My mom and my aunt decided that since I don't work I should drive over there ( about a half hour away) and take care of her everyday. I told them that I can't do that because my daughter has to be in school, my daughter also has some learning issues and when things get off schedule she gets really out of whack. So for the last two days they have been mad and trying to make me feel guilty because I won't drop everything and go take care of her. When I tell them that she needs professional help they tell me that she doesn't want that and that they can't make her do anything she doesn't want to.  
On top of all that I just emotionally don't want to have to go there everyday and sit and watch her die, because like they said, we can't make her do anything she doesn't want to and that includes eating and taking care of herself.

Well the annual fee is about to come out, Iâ€™ve realized that I really just donâ€™t use it that much and itâ€™s not worth the cost, at all. Iâ€™m perfectly content cancelling it but since they all rely on it I decided on a solution. So Iâ€™ve contacted everyone that uses it as (about 3 people in all) and said that if they could chip in for the fee Iâ€™d keep it. Well everyone but one person have agreed to chipping in. 

The conversation went along the lines of 

Me saying that in order not to cancel it Iâ€™m asking people to chip in $25 so that I donâ€™t need to bear the cost. 

Him saying that I can go ahead and cancel because itâ€™ll stop him from spending his money â€œhahaâ€ 

Me saying that if he needs a solution to his impulsive spending I could just change the password â€œhahaâ€ 

Him complaining that it would affect his Amazon Turk stuff (Which, by the way, he went into without my permission on my account, changing my info (I did not use it but he could have at least askedâ€¦)) and that he really does not use it too often and that not even all of his purchases are â€œPrimeâ€ eligible

My saying that I only agreed to let him use Turk until his own account was verified 

Him saying that it wonâ€™t get verified until next week so I can change it then

At which point the conversation tapers off into discussion about passive income stuff. 


So herein lies my dilemma, would I be an asshole if I changed the password and locked him out of it, or would it cause unneeded animosity since one extra person using it is not really affecting me at all? 

Also: out of love of the 2 that did agree to help I would keep the account open either way, even if I have to come out of pocket.

This seems like the perfect sub to ask this question. So if you're willing to answer on those grounds, here's the hypothetical.

My father is very sick and needs a replacement kidney. He's on a wait list and may get chosen to receive a suitable donor organ. His doctor says the chances of getting the organ he needs before he dies are quite good, but not good enough to make any promises...and it is certain that there will be a lot of suffering and serious medical procedures necessitated while he waits, so he would be much better off finding a compatible donor to volunteer ASAP.

He asked his extended family, including me, and I told him I would take whatever test there is to see if I'm a viable donor. (But to be honest, I know I'm not willing to do it because I'm too much of a coward to really go through with surgery that is not absolutely necessary for my survival.) I take the test and discover that I am not a suitable donor for my father because of some uncorrectable defect and the doctor will not accept me.

Here's the question: If I only tell my father about the fact that I'm not a suitable donor, am I a liar, or am I telling the only truth that matters?

There's a legitimate medical reason why I can't do it, so I feel my personal selfish reason is totally moot, and I'm not lying when I say I won't do it because the doctor says it's not safe. I've always wondered if people agree with this thinking, and if not, was I an asshole to take the test to begin with? If so, why should this scenario force me to reveal my dark personal shortcomings?

TL;DR My dad needs a kidney and I won't give mine because I'm a coward. But it turns out I'm not a suitable donor and CAN'T give it anyway. Am I an asshole for just saying I can't and never admitting that I wouldn't if I could?

I said yes. Anyway, going into this relationship I was pretty clear that one of the things I'm most scared of is having a suffocating partner. I made it a point that I need my space but I've been feeling like I have trouble actually getting the point across sometimes. Anyway, in the month leading up to this trip we spent time at our homes far apart, but we were talking to each other every day, probably at a minimum of 2-3 hours spaced out throughout the day. I thought it was a lot sometimes, but everytime I tried to get out of it I felt like I kind of got slithered back in. Anyway, by the end of the month leading up to the trip I was feeling a little worn out. I asked her if we could take the three days before the trip to just not talk. And we agreed that was for the best. The first night she dealt with some issues but the second and third nights she called me again almost looking to pick a fight. We argued about something dumb. Anyway going into the first few days of the trip things seemed alright. We spoke and made up the night she got in. Things got worse though when we actually started trying to snowboard. I had never done it before and so she was gonna show me a few things, although eventually we decided to take a class. During the class, she started to get worn out pretty quick and eventually her legs were hurting, so she ended her lesson an hour early. When I finished my lesson, I was sad that she had to go early but I also felt like she was kind of mad at me for keeping on. The next day we tried actually snowboarding down the small slope next to our cabin. After we got to the bottom, she was tired and in pain (what I assumed to be soreness, although according to her after the fact was far more severe) so she decided to stay back. I asked her if it was alright if I went down the ski-lift once more and she said it was (she meanwhile was going to ask my mother to pick her up from the restaurant at the base of the mountain) , but again I felt like she was mad at me. Anyway, from the house, which you can also access via the slopes she messaged me saying she wasn't able to get in touch with my mom. I went looking around the place we rented and noticed that all of the cars were gone and none of the family was around. I figured she was kind of SOL on getting back, but she's an adult with a wallet and a phone.  Anyway, she got back and started talking about how she felt that I was treating her poorly and never giving her the time of day. But that can't be further from how I feel. Honestly we've been spending pretty much every second together with these few exceptions. She keeps bringing up how she has noone else here, and I know that- but sometimes I feel like she just demands my time. Like she'll fall asleep on my lap and expect me to stay there, and not move, and she'll grumble at me if I do. I'm not trying to be mean to her, and I was certainly not trying to be a dick in general. But I think I'm just getting frustrated with what feels like someone pulling for time I don't feel like I have. She on the other hand feels like she's doing a lot for me and not getting any reciprocation. She mentioned how much her ticket was to come on this trip with us, and she mentioned how she doesn't complain when I smoke (something she initially said attracted her to me) and her feeling was that I don't reciprocate as strongly. And sometimes that might be true. A lot of times she gets irritated at me when I don't say ""I love you"" to her before I go to bed. I know it's stupid to be using that word so early on, but I do honestly feel like a better person sometimes when I'm with her. But she expects me to constantly use it. To constantly reaffirm how I feel towards her, and I don't have the ability to do that on command. Anyway, we had a big fight where a lot of this stuff boiled to the surface.

After i washed my clothes i was waiting on a dryer. Eventually i got a hold of one. After asking the people if it was theirs, and no one replied that it was, I emptied it. I noticed the clothes were still a bit damp, but i wasn't about to just fill the drier back up and wait for the person to come back since there was multiple other people waiting on the driers, and i had no idea whose clothes these were.

So i put the damp clothes in a basket and off to the side, and loaded up my clothes. After i put my money in, the girl whose clothes they were showed up and got mad at me for unloading it when they were still damp. Am I the asshole?

Should also be noted that this girl was taking up 2 driers.

Edit:
Glad to see this got some attention as I feel it is an important issue.

Couple of facts:
-any time I've been late I've had my clothes moved, I have no qualms with this because it was my fault I was late. (Would you guys be mad if you showed up late to something and your seat you reserved was given away?)
-no one had seen the owner of the clothes for a while (not since they put their clothes in)
-someone else started removing this person's clothes from another drier (she was taking up 2 driers during ultra busy time) and I followed their lead

I have no regrets about not waiting, but I did notice that these clothes were still damp, and maybe I should have given her another minute or two of leeway.


My conclusion: I think she was being a selfish asshole for making us all wait and unload her stuff.  I think that I could have reacted to her asshole behavior more nicely and gave her more of a cushion.  But I was pissed and impatient and so was everyone else in line.  I think she was an asshole and it caused me to respond like an asshole.  I think what I did was fair, but still asshole-ish.

Even though you're supposed to ""describe **both sides in detail**"", most people can't help but let their personal bias bleed through. This post is long because I'm trying really hard to be upfront about my natural biases, but there's a quick **TL;DR** at the bottom if you want the basic, bias-crammed AITA.

I'll (31M) dive right into it: I've been living with my girlfriend (29F) for a year and a half now. We argue here and there like any couple, and have been working on our communication, especially when arguing. 

I'm a light sleeper. She's a heavy sleeper. Always have been. Always will be. She has an earlier sleep schedule than me, so I'm normally still awake for a while at night after she goes to bed, and she's normally awake in the morning while I'm still sleeping. 

At night I put on headphones while watching TV after she goes to bed so I don't wake her. She's now telling me that she never asked me to do that, which is true, but I don't want to run the risk of accidentally waking her.

Normally, when she wakes up before me she's pretty quiet, but she's woken me up before, because it just doesn't occur to her that she's being loud enough to wake me. I don't think it ever crosses her brain, because I think she cannot fathom how someone could be awaken so easily. Meanwhile I'm quiet as a mouse while she's asleep, because I can't fathom how noise *wouldn't* wake her up.

Here comes the asshole part. Last night I went to bed around 3am. (Neither of us have anything to wake up for for a couple of days, so fuck it, I'm staying up and sleeping in.) While she was sleeping, I was my usual mouse-like self. However, this morning she woke up at 8am because she couldn't sleep. I was awoken at 8:30am because she was talking to her friend on the phone. 

In her defense, she was speaking quietly, but what little bass she has in her voice still travels through the wall of our one-bedroom apartment. Although I couldn't hear what she was saying, it sounded like Charlie Brown's parents were talking in the living room just on the other side of the wall by my head. I continued to try to sleep but couldn't. 

For the sake of transparency, at this point I'll admit I did a bit of a dick move. I got up and closed the door somewhat loudly to get the point across that she woke me (I didn't slam it, but it was still loud.) I should have said something, but I was clouded by anger and sleepy head. I laid back down in bed for another ten minutes but she kept talking.

I got up again, accepting my fate of little sleep. She was still on the phone as I got dressed and put the leash on the dog. As I went outside to walk the dog, I heard her say something, but I kept walking out. 

I didn't hear her, assuming she was talking to her friend and not me, but again, I'll be transparent and admit that I left in a bit of a huff. Dick move, but part of us working on our communication is taking a moment to calm down before engaging in the argument. I took some deep breaths as I walked my dog, and prepared to talk to her when I got back.

I walk into the apartment and she's gone. I checked the parking lot and her car was gone too. I check my phone for anything from her, but nothing. This raised my anger again, so I was working on a text that told her off, but realized I should take some time to calm down. 

I deleted my text before I even finished it, browsed Reddit for a couple hours, and calmed down. I still hadn't heard from her, so I decided to break the silence. Here's my text verbatim: ""Mornin' babe! Hope you're having a swell day so far! When ya comin' back? Love you! [cute emojis]""

After another half hour or so she calls me back. She's calm, but says, ""What was going on this morning? I hope you weren't mad for me talking to my friend."" I say, ""Well yes, I was upset that you woke me up so early, but I've calmed down now.""

This triggered her. She starts telling me how she's not going to apologize for talking to her friend. I stay quiet because the only thing coming to my mind is blind anger. She continues telling me how she's not in the wrong. Whenever I tried to defend my position, she would interrupt me with her defense before I could finish. 

More transparency: At this point I'm seething because I'm not being heard, so the third or so time she interrupts me, I hang up on her. (Dick move, I know.) She calls back and I ignore it, then send a text saying, ""I'm mad. I need space.""

She sends me a text back telling me that she's mad too and that I was childish for walking out earlier instead of talking to her. 

This begins a text argument. (So much for space, but it's my fault for engaging.) I wont type out the rest of the argument unless someone has questions about it. It's quite long. The broad strokes are that I told her she's disrespecting my sleep when she's on the phone with her friends. She says she won't be a prisoner in my apartment and she can talk to her friends whenever she wants to.

As I typed this up, we agreed to talk about it later today after I've calmed down. Fair enough. 

I'm bringing this to AITA to find out if I'm really treating her like a prisoner because I expect her to send a text to her friends saying something along the lines of, ""Hey my boyfriend is sleeping. We can text or I can call you in a little bit after he wakes up."" But of course, let me know if I'm being an asshole anywhere else during this tale. If anyone has any questions, I'll be open and honest with my answer because I really want to get to the bottom of this.

Two people have texted me whining about the price. One guy said you can get those games for $25...Yeah right! Show me where Skyrim, Gears, or Titanfall are 25. Besides, I said the price is negotiable so its annoying that these people come right out whining to me rather than just try to barter.

I've since reposted the price at $380 and still negotiable to hopefully cut down on the whiners. Idk its just annoying, like I said its negotiable..whining to me just means I'm not going to deal with you. AITA?

I drove to his city and when I was looking at it I could tell it needed to be cleaned really well and needed some other TLC. Also it was slightly a different color than I thought (light silver vs white). 

We started to take the camper off his truck and I said ""we need to talk about the price""

He got super angry and acted like I was going back on the deal we made over the phone and told me ""nobody was jewing him"" (which I found incredibly offensive). 

I was in another city tho and I stammered ""I just want a fair price for everyone - just let me think about it"". 

I waited for a bit and he looked at some other prices on Craigslist and then told me he'd give me the price I'd asked for.

Was I an asshole for talking about the price before I saw it?



Edit: I wasn't trying to change the price by pausing and thinking about it. I was genuinely thinking about it - not a negotiating tactic. 

But looking back I definitely implied that I was gonna pay the original price on the phone before looking at it. Chock it up to inexperience, but it was an asshole move. I'm pretty new to buying off of Craigslist and I pretty much hate it right now cause I feel like we were both assholes!

(And I'm a boy) Let's call her Stephanie/Steph. Our relationship was pretty average for a different gender relationship. I'd usually tease her about something, she'd tease me back, borderline flirting, but me being in the 6th grade I would've never called it flirting. 

So towards the end of the school year, graduation only a few weeks away, Steph passes me a note in class. We always pass notes, no biggie. To avoid detection of the teacher, I hold off on reading the note for a bit. A few seconds pass and Steph whispers, ""Read it, it's important."" Stealthily as I could, I unfold the note just enough to read what's scribbled on it. 

""Want to go out?""
I quickly close the note back up. I've watched enough Disney Channel to know Highschool relationships never work out, let alone Elementary school relationships. Plus, the idea of a relationship freaked me out/sounded ridiculous at age 12. 

Minutes pass, and we're let go for free time. She immediately confronts me. 
""Did you read it?""
In a tone I usually use to tease her with I quickly reply,
""Y'know what? I'm not gonna read this note.""
I crumple the paper up and throw it in the trash.

My defense: It's the 6th grade, no way it lasts all the way through middle school+high school. We'd definitely ruin our relationship. Handling things this way, I wouldn't have to flat out friend-zone/deny her, and we could move past it.Probably broke her 6th grade heart though.

so, i've been kicked out of my place, lost my job and now I have to move back in with my parents in my small home town 6 hours away. the same small town that gave me these issues and depression. 

Long story short. 6 months ago, myself, and three others James, Clyde and stacy (all fake names) decided to all move in together in a house. 

We didn't think there would be a problem seeing as three of us (all early 20's guys) had already lived together for a few years/months before this point. and one was close friend

and I will say, The apartment WAS messy. the kind of messy you would expect from 3 20something guys. OF course we did all try to keep it clean and maintained. I remember several times making daily chore lists and delegating tasks for a bi monthly clean up. But alas. we were all messy in our own ways and it never really got better.

Initially there were supposed to be four of us moving in, One for each of the four bedrooms. But james decided to have his girlfriend jenny move in as well. To which we all agreed so long as we split the utilities between all of us. 

later, she became upset because in a heated argument over their own moldy cheese (they were upset that I didn't throw it out for them, because she's allergic to mold. but i've always been taught just to cut the mold off of cheese. and I wasn't aware of her allergy.) I told her that she didn't actually have much say in the household matters because she wasn't paying rent. 

my ""being rude"" to her  has become one of the main reasons that they kicked me out.


before we moved. myself and stacy had a slight argument over what stuff goes where. she essentially said that she intended to bring family and friends over, so she wanted us guys to keep ""our crap"" out of the public areas. for context, all three of us guys are gamers. We all have high end PC's and tv's consoles and etc. 

my issue was that I wasn't happy with my possessions being referred to as ""crap"" and ""junk""

AND we weren't sure what the layout of the house would be.So I didn't want each of us to have to be confined to our rooms because the main living rooms had to be free of our stuff. 

Lo and behold. We found a decent place where we could each get what we had wanted. There was a spacious basement for our ""man cave"" and the mid floor could be kept untouched. 

Unfortunately, Problems kept arising. there were messes, People were leaving things in places. and I feel like there was a lot of unfair double standards being hoisted upon me. for example. a book I left on the coffee table was tossed into my room because it was ""A mess"" while several Ikea magazines were left on the other coffee table since we moved in.

I would be expected to drop whatever I was doing to clean up any inconvenience, while there were several points where I would simply work around other people's messes. 

A turkey roaster and pile of magazines would be left in the corner of the living room and go unnoticed until I put a box of home brewed wine in the same corner. 

or when I leave a couple of dirty dishes at my desk it's an issue. But when one of my roomates has a similar pile in their bedroom, it's never brought up.

getting down to it. My roomates are upset both by the messes, but seemingly moreso of the fact that I would argue that something was a blaring double standard. 


my roomates are upset that ""everything has to be an argument"" 

to that I would say, it wouldn't need to be an argument if everybody was treated with the same standards. 

not to mention that A lot of the so called ""messes"" were in my eyes very minor and over exaggerated.

 http://imgur.com/a/t42UC Here's an example of two of them, and the reactions that followed. 

the first one I admit was me I was up late and made myself some food before going to bed with the plans to wash the dishes in the morning. The crumbs I didn't notice in the dimly lit kitchen. The second one Was blamed on me, though I had been at work in the time it was made,

Those are just the most recent two that I could save before I deleted the group chat, because I was tired of the petty bickering. 

and Clyde for the most part just wants to stay neutral. He moved everything he owns to his room and pretty much never leaves it except for work, because He knows he would be targeted for the same stuff I am.

I'm currently graduated from secondary school and waiting to get into a college. Once I'm in college, I'll get a laptop for school work. There's about 3 months till it starts. 


My (younger) brother took up a part time job recently and used his pay to buy a new computer. He replaced the old computer, which our dad had bought for the two of us to use, and everything that was hooked up to the old computer, keyboard, mouse, printer monitor, was connected to the new one. 


Now, I wouldn't mind using the old computer, but the thing is there are no other monitors, keyboards, mouses, etc in our home and I feel it is unfair I have to fork out money just to use the same computer I've always been using. What's more, there isn't enough space in the house for another computer setup. 


I just want to occasionally use it to play a bit of Overwatch/TF2 from time to time, as well as maybe write a few blog posts. I understand he worked and earned the money to buy the computer and it is completely his, I just want to use it for three months because it is the only computer in our household I can use. 


I have brought it up to our father a couple of times. The first time, my brother agreed to let me use it, but after a few days of complaining about why I logged out from his Steam/Spotify/Facebook, he locked it again. 


I just brought it up to our dad again and after a small argument where my brother insisted the computer belonged to him, my father said he'd pay him the full cost of the computer. He said he didn't want our household to become one where we fought over and refused to share our stuff. If he gave my brother the money for it, then it belonged to him was his logic.

Me: Andy

Guy 1: David

Guy 2: Jacob

So through a mutual friend I met another couple, David and Jacob, (*we are all gay*) at an event two of us were working at a bar (*myself and David *) while his boyfriend Jacob hung out and had some beers while we worked. I don't normally work in the bar but it was a special event to raise money and we were both volunteers.

Anyway, throughout the night David was greeting people and doing his door thing and I was working behind the bar but we would relieve each other when we needed breaks but we talked before and after and we had a ton in common. 

At the same time his Jacob kept coming up and chatting with me and I liked him as well. He had a lot of personality and they both were really nice, smart, around my age and attractive. Jacob pulled me aside at one point and said something along the lines of ""hey, I don't really know how to say this without coming off strange but there is something about you I really like. You are funny, nice and I find you really attractive. You should also know that I told David that about you and we have an agreement that we can play around with other guys if we talk about it. So... just throwing that out there if you are ever interested but if you just want to be friends that is cool too.""

I was flattered and a little surprised because I wasn't expecting that because my mind was more focused on hustling to get drinks out to the partrons so while it was in the back of my head I kept doing my work serving drinks. After we finished they asked me to have some drinks with them so I said ""of course"". At the very least I felt like I could make some new friends and honestly I thought ""hey, maybe these guys both want to have sex with me and what the hell. It could be a lot of fun and I'm single and they are cool with it so why not.""

So we are all having some laughs and fast forward later Jacob gets really strange and he says something like ""I hate myself, I'm so awkward, etc."" and I was kind of surprised because I didn't think that at all. I told him ""no, you are great. I think you are a nice guy and I'm glad we met. Don't say those things about yourself.""

He brightened up but later got strange again and disappeared. I don't know where he went and I asked David ""if he was okay"" and he said he gets strangely moody at times. Jacob comes back and he is fine so I think everything is cool and he was just having a moment. 

Well Jacob disappears again. He smokes a lot so I figured he was just outside having another smoke. At the same time David started bumping into me suggestively and then starts kissing me. So I go with it. 

Jacob comes back and is smiling but then he needs to have some conversation with David so I figure ""um, okay I'll let them talk and if this is not what they want I'll just back off"". They both come back like 5 minutes later and Jacob says to me ""oh David wants to talk to you"". 

Me: ""Um okay, about what?""

Him: ""I don't know he just wants to chat.""

So I follow David into another part of the bar and he is all over me. He is kissing me everywhere and I'm thinking ""this is great, Jacob was smiling earlier, this is probably some setup to invite me back to their place together so I'm going with it.""

After maybe 10 minutes I say to David ""let's get back to Jacob because I feel bad just letting him sit there.""

We get back and he is fucking gone. He took both of our coats which had my house keys, David's house keys, his phone and his money. 

We searched everywhere for him and he just fucking checked out. David starts getting really upset and I don't know what the hell to do. I told him ""hey, let's just get out of here there is a 24 hour coffee place right down the street I'll get you a coffee to help sober you up and we can figure out what they hell we are going to do."" 

This all really fucking sucks by the way because it is winter and neither one of us have coats, keys and like I said he didn't have his money or phone. 

We get coffee and he really starts crying. He tells me their relationship is falling apart and he doesn't know what to do and is just sobbing. Like sobbing so hard I haven't heard anyone sob in years. 

So I'm there and I really don't know what the hell I'm going to do. My landlord doesn't do afterhour lockouts. It's like 4:00 in the morning. I don't know who to call (*normally I'd call and crash at a friends place and get new keys later or in this case hopefully my jacket back which already had my keys*) but David doesn't want to go home and I don't want to leave the guy sobbing on the street. 

So I put us in a cab and I go to a hotel near my house. I got one with two rooms so he knew without a doubt that I wasn't trying to get in his pants anymore and I just wanted to make sure he was okay. We get there and check in and he is still sobbing his heart out so I just let him talk and listen. 

I encourage him to take a shower or bath (*one to get him to sober up a little more*) and two I know that a warm shower always makes me feel better when I'm sad. 

I hang out on the hotel balcony, fuck around with the TV and try and give him some time. I can hear him fucking wailing and sobbing in the bath so after like 10 minutes of this I go and quietly knock on the door and ask if he is okay and wants to talk anymore. He asks me to come in so I sit on the floor next to him and just let him talk. 

After ahwhile he cheers up a bit and then he starts kissing on me again and I kissed back start rubbing his chest and then I just said ""stop, we can't do this. I can't do this. You are really vulernable right now and I can tell you are hurting. This is not going to make you feel better and I can't have sex with you or anything because I just can't take advantage of this situation when you are feeling so sensastive.""

I put him to bed and we wants me to lay with him so we shared the bed and I just laid there and let him talk and rubbed his head and comforted him until he was soon fast asleep and snoring. 

We wake up this morning and I hear him in the bathroom crying again. 

I felt awful. At the same time I'm thinking ""where in the fuck is his BF? Why did he take my fucking coat and basically lock me out of my house and also screw David by leaving him with no money, no keys and no phone?""

I feel like I some how read everything wrong at the bar and just walked into some bad situation and somehow fucked up their relationship. 

Frankly I didn't know what the hell to do and yes we kissed and rubbed against each others bodies but I stopped it because it just didn't feel right. 

This morning I got him a coffee and walked him home (*fucking cold as hell - again no coats*) and feeling like I just didn't want to even talk to anyone I went and broke into my own house. Fuck it... I'll deal with that later. 

But now I've been sitting here for 2 hours feeling like a real asshole and I fucked the whole situation up somehow.  

**tl;dr: Two guys who were into me (*and a couple*) invited me for drinks and suggested at sex then shit got weird. His BF freaked out and ditched us with no coats or keys, phone, etc. and I spent half the night comforting his BF at a hotel because I didn't know what else the fuck to do since I couldn't get in my house and he didn't want to go home. Now I feel like I fucked everything up.**

We had a spare room and didn't really need to rent but I knew she'd just changed jobs so couldn't afford much, plus I thought it would be nice to have her around and we'd be helping her out rent wise.

The apartment is brand new and costed quite a bit (my bf owns it) and shortly after she moved in I got annoyed because she didn't seem to be as conscious or careful/caring of the property as I/we would have liked her to have been (or as much as we are). 

She's not messy at all - but it was the little things that added up like: 1) breaking a mug and didn't tell us or offer to replace (we wouldn't have minded but an offer to telling us as a min. would have been appreciated) 2) she roasted a chicken (totally okay) but didn't use any foil and grease splattered all over the inside of the oven, she said she would clean but then didn't and then got upset later when we asked if she could please use foil because ""ovens aren't meant to be cleaned"" 3) leaves minor chocolate stains on the couch, she probably doesn't notice because they are small but I end up dabbing to them out

Now she's a great flatmate, always wants to cook for us or her friends, chatty and actually really clean compared to a lot of people. But I got a bit OCD/paranoid from things like the examples above, and instead of confronting her I just started to clean around her (like sweep the laundry after she left a bit of powder on the floor or clean out the laundry when she left a clump of solidified powder in there). 

Yesterday we both finally reached our limit and argued about it and she said that she doesn't feel like it's her home and she's stressed all the time because I'm cleaning after/around her and she doesn't think she's messy at all. She's always trying to make sure things are clean more than normal now and I've been basically awful to make her feel like that. Also we do have a weekly cleaner and she doesn't understand why she needs to be super clean if we pay someone to come around (okay, I get that)

I agreed maybe I can tune back the OCD. But she feels like she has an equal share to the flat because she does pay rent. But ultimately I feel like my bf owns the flat and we should be grateful we pay so little rent and repay the gratefulness by making sure everything is really well looked after. 

I hate that I've turned into ""that"" kind of ""landlord"" to live with (I get that I don't even own the house but trying to manage my bfs feelings of his property) and I am ashamed some of the things I've resented her for are a bit petty.

Iâ€™d bet it would look good on youâ€.

He seemed a bit taken back by my comment.

I donâ€™t want him to think that he isnâ€™t good enough or that I donâ€™t accept him as he is, that isnâ€™t true at all, I just thought he would look good trimmed up. Heâ€™s not expressed that heâ€™s upset to me or anything, and I think Iâ€™m probably just overthinking it and he probably just saw it as a random comment in the midst of a longer conversation, but looking back on my comment I feel bad for having made it, especially since I wouldnâ€™t have made it sober unless we had been together for a lot longer than a month.

As a continuation from this. For context of anybody needs it. 

My roommates have kicked me out, and are still living in the house. 

They are bringing in another of their friends to take my place. 

And because of the way the damage deposit is. They won't get it until they all move out. 

I feel it's unfair to me that my part of the damage deposit be used to give this new person a free ride. So I asked that they charge this new person for at least 3/4 of my part of the damage deposit. And buy out my part essentially. 

They say that this is unfair to the new person as according to them there are already enough damages that we wouldn't get anything back. This is in the forms of two chips in the already warped and chipped counter. And a spot of paint(paint remover that I painted over to keep it from further rusting)  on the dryer. 

I say three things in response.

1. The landlord's have already replaced the refrigerator, the dishwasher, and the oven, without concern. 

(I fixed the handle on the old oven whicj was the only issue and the landlord's preferred to keep it and the put the new second hand oven in storage just in case.)

2. Every appliance in the house is second hand.  

3. There's no way we've done $2000 of damage to the house in the past six months. 

4. There is another set of working washer and dryer sitting in the laundry room unused for that exact purpose. 


They've also said that I should pay for half the water on the utilities bill because I started taking an extra shower towards the end because it relieves stress for me. 

They didn't include that there are 6 people currently living there and one extra who's been staying on our couch because of a bad breakup. 

One extra shower isn't going to jack up the utilities any more than an extra person living there. IMHO. 

I've told them that my funds are on freeze until I get my damage deposit back.

I am an aspiring musician, and I often come here to do some research personally for my self development as a person and for my music. Due to being a broke ass bitch, I don't have money for headphones at the moment. So, I have to listen to my music off the CPU's built in speakers, which can carry a little bit if it's relatively quiet but not by any means clear or boisterous and I always try to keep it at about half for the sake of others. Not loud enough to put vocals down or anything but enough to catch the gist of track and get my creative juices going. But, there's this guy who for all intensive purposes call him Tom. 

Every time Tom walks into the computer, I sigh a breath of impending aggrevation to myself. He has an affinity to only use one computer (Background Info. Digression: the shelter is pretty run down, but in comparison to the other options in town its the ""Taj Mahal"" of homeless shelters), anyway, the computer room has bedbugs. (Some Taj Mahal, js.) I know someone has seen the a bed bug in the chair on the left side of the two man station where the computers are situated. 

So Tom tends to lean toward the left side of the computer station. {Which seems ridiculous to me, since the bedbugs are just going to stay to one side of the room when the whole shelter has them}. If someone happens to be on the right side of the station when I arrive, and leaves before Tom does, or right as Tom does. Her will wait, and for me to get off the right side of the computer even though there is a completely and equally infested computer right across from me. He tells me that he saves his files on the computer on the right side. But the computers are wiped daily at two in the morning. (shelter doesn't want people saving on the computers). So I doubt that is the reason. In any event he argues that for some inexplicable reason it saves his files on this computer. 

But the real kicker is that he plugs his LOUD speaker to the CPU, and blasts his music or listens to news and conspiracy theories for HOURS at a time with no consideration of anyone else at all. If I turn the computer up to a 100 percent I can't even hear my music, and if I could it's a conflict of ODDISEE and Issa Gold from my side and Stevie Wonder and The Whispers and various country artists and Alex Jones that swell into this ear bleeding cacophony of soulful hell. 

I can't get any work done with this, and unfortunately I don't have an ID (lost my wallet) so I can't just escape and go to the library to escape. No phone either. Life is pretty ass atm, but I know it will pick up again. But, what I don't know is the bigger asshole in this situation? Him or I? Should I ask him to turn it down? He's a pretty bitter, admittedly negative, and just overall surly. I feel like he's just seeking attention, and if I ask him to turn it turn he's just getting the attention he wants (negative or positive). I don't know. Reddit, help a brother out please ??

We are both college freshman who were in a relationship for 2.5 years before we got to college. The first semester was rough, she danced and grinded on one of her guy friends, and she was drinking more than ever (which is expected, it got annoying though). I broke up with her over Thanksgiving break. I felt terrible a few days after because I didn't really even give her a chance to fix things. She knew I was having problems, but I blindsided her, so I asked if she wanted to try again.

Fast forward to Winter Break. Things are still a little shakey, so I offer her two options: we can try again, or we can take a break and see if this is what we really want. She chose the second option, and I was fine with that. 

We agreed to keep in contact but not as much, and we would be allowed to do stuff with other people aside from oral or sex. I try texting her the first whole week, but she keeps blowing me off until last Thursday. She calls me and asks to break up. I asked her if this had to do with her friend that she grinded on (how I was suspicious of for a long time), and she said yes. 

I was sad to break up but devastated that it was because of him. I text her a few days after for a better explanation, and I find out that two days after she broke up with me, she had sex with him. It took us 2.5 years to have sex.

I'm absolutely furious, and she says that I have no right to judge her and she wants to be friends. I can't even look at her the same way.

Our rules state that no resident may park in a way that could impede another from exiting/entering their residence. Everyone tries to be courteous but we only have one car spot in the 2 car garage (since our washer and dryers and water heater are located in the garage and state law says a barrier to prevent a car hitting the any of that must be in place before a car may be parked on that side of the garage). We also have a parking lot of 11 spaces for 12 units that is always packed. 



So this all started the day my boyfriend and I moved into our new house.  Now, I grew up in the South and maybe things are different in other places, but generally you welcome new neighbors to the neighborhood. We bought a house in California and day one, while we're moving in, our neighbor comes over and tells us not to park in the left spot in front of our garage because she has trouble pulling out of her garage if a car is there as the houses sit perpendicular to eachother. No hello, no introduction, no welcome to the neighborhood, just ""Don't park there.""  Okay....nice to meet you too.



Of course, I don't want to make a stir, because I'm not one to cause a scene so I just smile and ensure her we'll make sure not to park there.  And we don't. It's super inconvenient for us because at the time we had three cars so one goes in the garage, one on the right side of the drive and the third just has to hope there's a spot open in the parking lot. 



We've lived here for over a year now. Twice a car was parked there out of necessity (my boyfriend) because there were no spots available.  The first time, she came over and asked that we move the car. And I moved it for her right then and appologized. The second, much later, I left the house to get the mail and she is standing there waiting and starts yelling at me about needing to leave her house and having to wait on me. Apparently she had rung our doorbell, which had broken a week prior so I had no idea she was waiting for me to move my car. Why she didn't knock, I have no idea. I have dogs and they would have barked a few times if someone knocked so I know she didn't. My boyfriend had moved my car to do some work in the garage and forgot to tell me so I had no idea there was a car in her way. Her attitude was passing me off but I again apologized and moved the car for her, very politely.



Now I want also add that this lady leaves her house maybe once a month and a car in our drive does not block her from backing out of her garage. You would have to cut the wheel pretty far but it by no means blocks anyone in. So the fact that she sat out there stewing and getting mad at me about it is pretty ridiculous to me. Especially since she stayed mad at me once I explained the doorbell didn't work.   



A WHOLE YEAR LATER, a friend needed a new place on short notice because of a bad roommate. We have a spare room and decided to rent it out to him. He has one car. So now we have four cars in a neighborhood that is quickly running out of parking spaces as a lot of other people in the community are buying new cars. I get a knock on my door. It's the neighbor. Unbeknownst to me, my roommate has parked in the forbidden spot because there were no other spots available in the community. She puts up a huge fuss about it, I apologize and go wake up my roommate, who works nights, (it's 11am at this point) and he moves his car to a red curb so she can get out. She didn't leave for another hour or two so he had to stay up until she left so he could put his car back into a legal spot. 


I have to stress that we've parked in that spot now 3 times in almost 2 years and somehow, I am always the one getting bitched at by this lady even though I am never the one to park there and she knows this. She's incredibly rude about it every time, cutting me off when I apologize and lecturing me as if we do this on a daily basis and acts like we're parking directly behind her car when in reality, she could pull out without us moving.  



The night before last, my roommate parked there again. He gets home at 3am and there were no other spots. It was pouring raining and it's basically a crap shoot as to whether this lady will leave her house tomorrow or not so he parked on the left side of the drive. I have no idea about it.  The next day, there's a knock on my door. Guess who?  She starts yelling immediately.  ""Whose car is that?!"" I got about as far as, ""Oh, I'm sorry, Matt works nights, he's slee..."" before she cuts me off ""Go get him! I don't care if he's sleeping, I want to talk to him.""  Now, I'm a polite person and I don't like confrontation but I'm not going to be yelled at on my doorstep and have demands made of me. So I slammed to door in her face and went back to what I was doing. She yelled through the door that she would call the police and she wanted that car moved now. Matt slept until 3pm and then got up for work. I didn't wake him up to move his car. He texted me later to let me know that she yelled at him too when he left about having his car towed. 



 Was I wrong here? I don't mind not parking there even though it's a pain in the ass and I certainly don't mind moving my car for her since I'd told her we would avoid parking there but her attitude is always shitty, and I'm just trying to be polite and fix the situation.

He had warned me previously that the dog will sometimes deliberately slip his collar and make a run for it. I try to be mindful of this whenever I walk him.

After the dog had done his business, I was encouraging him back up the apartment stairs when he stood and looked at me for a second. Then he jerked his head, popping his collar off, and took off like a bullet.
Without knowing what to do and afraid we'd never find him if I lost sight of him, I bolted after the dog. I chased him for blocks and blocks through the suburbs, cutting through peoples' backyards, through fields, through the bad part of the neighborhood, and finally edging onto the main roads. The dog avoided me like his life depended on it, and I lost sight of him multiple times but kept going. At one point a woman gave me a ride in her car to catch up with him.

Eventually, the dog made a mistake, and I was able to catch him in a fenced-in garden.

Edit: I decided that I was being an asshole for ascribing malicious intent to her not being attracted to me. I told her ""Even though, it may take me a lot longer to get over you, I've decided that I'm not going to not be friends with you because I really value your friendship."" I value the friendship even more than I necessarily value my feelings. And I was being kind of dramatic. It's not really even an infatuation or love I have for her. It was more of a crush. I can easily get over her while still being able to stay ""besties"" with her. I think I'm just gonna stop going out of my way for her now which would probably make both of us more comfortable anyway. She told me it was really mean and she felt sad when I said that. I told her that I'm sorry and that was that I guess. Thanks for all of your help and opinions. 

Last edit: Apparently she cried when I told her that I wanted to pull back so I do think I made the right decision here. I doubt she's trying to mainpulate me.

The conversation went a little something like this 

Me: I want you to know that I really value your friendship and appreciate you and you told me that a few weeks ago and I just realized that I've never really told you that so yeah

Her: Yeah I'm really glad you decided to not to stay away because when you said that I got really sad and cried.

Me: I'm sorry. I couldn't stay away from *insert her pet name here*

Her: it's okay and good

Me: what can I do to make it up to you?

Her: everything's fine as long as we stay friends :-)

Me. Always...even if you use 2010 emojis

I've been with this same guy since we were really young (think early teens). We both come from somewhat broken homes. His mom was a meth addict, and the story is pretty complicated but essentially his father left, remarried and got custody of the kids. Kids disassociate from mom and his siblings essentially tell her that they want to cut contact completely.

Years and years later, MIL gets sober, gets a great job, cleans up her act. FIL, Step-MIL and co. get pretty toxic for a multitude of reasons, one being that we decided to accept MIL back into our lives. Eventually we decide the toxicity is too much, and we cut contact from FIL, Step-MIL and siblings.

It's been about a year and MIL still tries to reach out to us for us to comfort her when she tries to look up her kids and ex (especially since there are a few news articles about one of her kids achievements). She often tries to ask us how they are doing, if we are ever going to contact them again, any news, etc. Every time we clearly tell her that we have cut contact and do not wish to speak about them.

MIL just stopped smoking about a week ago and reached out to me the morning, the text convo goes as follows:

MIL: Hope I'm not bugging u. I'm just having a rough morning. Wanted to say love u â¤â¤

Me: Love you too. Sorry to hear about the tough morning, want to tell me about it?

MIL: Googled [daughter] name and saw articles about her and [father]. I missed out on so much. Can't stop crying. Quitting smoking is hard! Lol

Me: wow yeah sounds like it

You gotta stop googling your ex

It's like classic breakup 101

MIL: ???? 

Me: She's cut off from you. You know that you can't keep clinging and obsessing. 

MIL: Wow

The guy I'm seeing hung back as he was planning on spending the night, and a female friend didn't seem to want to leave so I offered her to stay and chat as we wouldn't be going to sleep right away. 


She just went through a breakup about 2 weeks ago and since then, I've discussed the situation with her in person and via text on three separate occasions. It was obviously on her mind, so she started the relationship story from the beginning to get my date up to speed (he is friends with her also, albeit not as close). 


The conversation dragged on and before I knew it, it was 12:15am. I have to be up at 5:45am everyday for work (10 hour shift) and the kitchen was still full of dishes from dinner, so I walked into the next room and started washing while my date and friend continued the conversation about her feelings. Right as I was finishing up the dishes, she came into the kitchen to tell me she was heading home. I had intended to let them know they could stay up as long as they wanted, but I was going to sleep as soon as I finished cleaning (but it never came to that).


My date came into the kitchen after and essentially said that it had been sort of rude of me to walk away in the middle of the conversation since it's obviously still fresh for her and she wanted people to talk to about it. He said he would have stayed up and washed dishes after she left since he knew how exhausted I was. I explained that this wasn't the first time she and I have discussed the situation and I felt she was catching him up more so than discussing it with me, but he suggested that next time I be more sensitive to the situation. I ended up going to bed a little after 1am.

We usually get along pretty well, but she's always needed to have the upper hand in our relationship. For years now, it's been irritating me that she rarely picks up the phone when I call her. She'll call back, but it can be a few days later.

I already follow all the ""rules."" I don't call in the evening or on weekends because it's pointless. She won't pick up during those times no matter what. This already bothers me because I know I couldn't count on her in an emergency. Plus, I know she's not that busy. There's no way she's completely occupied from Friday afternoon all the way through Monday morning. 

Last time I called her was in late December, for three days in a row, and it was actually important but, of course, no answer. The kicker is, I was actually calling because I was trying to help her out. I had something time-sensitive that she needed to know but she blew me off. I don't feel bad that I wound up never telling her.

I have seen her since then- once at my parent's  house and once at her house for her kid's birthday party. I was perfectly nice both times and acted like nothing was wrong and we got along fine.

 She must have picked up on the fact that I'm not talking to her by now but I know her and she won't ask.

So the link above is the thread in question. It started out standard enough, as a discussion of player tendencies in a video game, but then rapidly devolved. The guy I was talking to, the OP of the post, was getting heated in the other comments he was making, which factored into how I responded to him.

I know that I realistically should have stopped engaging him and left it all alone, and I really did try to do that. But I noticed on my profile that the number of comments had shot up, so I decided to read through the new ones. I noticed that the OP was accusing another user of being an alt account of mine, simply because we both disagreed with him and thought he needed to calm down a bit. So I commented once more and explained the situation, hoping to end it there. But as you can see, the OP got even more heated, and started insisting that I (and the other commenter as well) had mental problems.

I know that I definitely have some blame in this scenario, since I had a couple opportunities to stop, but am I the asshole here?

Ok, I will try and make this sound as unbiased as possible.

I run a start-up company with my business partner and we semi-regularly travel away on business, we travelled 2 times in 2016 and likely to travel 3-4 times in 2017.

We have sold our biggest order so far a few days ago (woo! it's only 8k but it's massive to us) and now we need to deliver it to Spain.

- One option is we pay for delivery as usual and they will receive it in a few weeks.
- Another is to hire a large van and deliver it ourselves, that way we save a small amount of money on the delivery and we get to demo our other products to the buyer.

Needless to say, the second option sounds much more fun, which is the main reason we want to do it.

My wife HATES it when I travel, whether it is for work or on the occasional boys trip with my friends - she will always find a reason to not approve of it. She say's things like ""Am I not enough for you"", ""Why do I always have to miss out"", ""You don't even want to go to America"" or ""You have it so easy"" etc.

She says this despite us going on holiday 2 or 3 times a year and her going on the occasional trip away with her friends.

Some facts which may sway your opinion:

- We don't have Children
- We earn the same salary
- She dislikes my business partner
- She thinks I have never done a hard days work in my life
- She is kind of a jealous person and spends a lot of time focussing on what other people have

0,1,0,0,0,1558302894.0626528,1,5t8w2t,17,1486750438.0,False,31,"**Background:** A little over a year ago my dog was dying.  I lived alone with only him, dedicated all my spare time to dog rescue, and eventually stopped fostering because he didn't want to share his home with dogs; he was my best friend.  (So if you are not someone who has never been utterly destroyed by a dog dying, just assume it was a hell of a lot harder for me than you might guess.)  He developed a heart condition and was in the animal hospital for several days when it first struck, and there were many such episodes over the course of months. There was a very expensive major surgery they wanted to try that had a moderate chance of helping.  I anguished about it for a day and decided to do it.  (Although the money mattered to me, the real question was whether to put him through a major procedure that wasn't much more than 50% likely to help.)  Because of my rescue connections, hundreds of people--many of whom I have never personally met--knew about my dog and had followed my updates and photos about him for years.  When they heard I was going to pay for this procedure, they started a GoFundMe and raised $3,000 to help...which was amazing.  

**The Issue:** The whole time this was going on, I was going to work full time, driving to the animal hospital to visit afterward (if he was there), spending several hours there if I could, then would come home late and write a long Facebook post to update anyone who was concerned before doing everything else an adult living alone has to do after work in a normal week.  At first, the facebook posts worked because most of my family and friends saw the feed and that saved me from having to go through the story over and over.  But after the GoFundMe started, I felt I owed it to the network of donors who had also friended me on FB to make updates, so they got really detailed about procedures, and treatment choices.  

My father, during this period, got upset because he wasn't getting regular phone updates from me on my dog's problem.   He has access to Facebook, but forgot his password and didn't feel like recovering it because he could still log in on an iPad he didn't like to use because it was old and slow.  He would try to call while I was talking to a vet or trying to write everyone else's update, and even if the time wasn't inconvenient, I didn't want to have this conversation once, twice, or more.  I put the details out there for everyone, and it was anguishing describing the condition, theories, and decisions in writing so everyone could know.  I was already exhausted, depressed, and ashamed I couldn't do more...I didn't want to have retread it all again for anyone and have to sit through 20 questions about whether we considered each absolutely obvious possibility or treatment.   

**The conflict:** His point of view was that he's my father, and it's not unusual for him to want to express his support on the phone personally in a tough time...and even if I found it unusual, he deserves special treatment.   If I didn't answer one of his calls every night and repeat everything that happened with the dog that day, he felt slighted, even though absolutely no one else in my life demanded anything individual--not even the friend who set up the fund drive or any of the donors.  My point of view was that he is retired and bored and wants attention, but for the duration of this problem, he should boot up his fucking iPad and let me try to get some sleep.  So I didn't answer most calls, and when he texted, I told him the answers were on facebook and occasionally sent a new picture.   Am I the asshole?  

It's weird to go back over this after a year, but we still have this same basic fight where he wants to be needy and possessive of my time, and I'm exhausted because I work all day while he's retired but he believes he deserves more slack than I'm giving him...and I don't know where the line is.",[AITA] Am I the asshole for wanting to Facebook my grief updates instead of deal with repeated personal calls to everyone who cares?,0.97,6,"No, NTA.

It's hosted by an organization called democracy earth, and they have their own specific project. The same goes for all other participants, they all have their own agendas. It's important to note that everyone there has at least one PhD.

I asked a few questions about the scope of the project they were working on, (in the host organization project), the reply was, ""well it kind of depends.""I repeated the question in a different way a couple of times but the answer was the same, then he asked what I have to offer. So I gave them my pre-prepared pitch. Someone then informed me that I was not on the proper discussion thread for this and suggested I go to the more technical discussion thread, so I did, and I asked if I could post it there, and they responded go ahead, so I did. There was no response for several hours on either discussion thread, where there had been steady conversation prior on both.

Here's where I should mention that my proposal is an entire worldwide monopoly on opinions. This means no other entity can exist in this market, including the project they are working on. Or anyone else's project for that matter.

If you ruled the world and decided one day, because you are a nice person, that you wish to know the desires of your people, and you really meant it, would you?

A). Have people design all different kinds of Organizations that work in different ways, with different questions to answer, and then take all that and try to figure out what the people want.

                   OR

B). Get the best people together you can to build one system using the best agreed-upon technology,(Google search engines).

The founding fathers of the United States did not decide to ""farm out"" the voting process to a variety different organizations for this obvious reason.

All those other direct democracy initiatives require you to traverse menus, and answer questions. The limited amount of data they are working with and their use of questions, makes it unfeasible for them to use search engines.

Removing questions enables google style search engines, which then enables unlimited data, which then allows for a monopoly on the opinion market, owned by the ""people"".

I'm sorry for all that material but it's important for you to understand my angle. I think if you believe in direct democracy for the people, then you should wish for the best system possible!

I'm going to try and shorten this up here, several hours after I posted my plan someone tried to change the topic, and so I tried to steer it back towards some kind of response to the post I made. Both of the discussion lines completely shut down for over a week after that. 

Since I was not getting a response I decided to add some pressure, I began posting everything on Reddit and informed them that I was doing so. I also made a post on r/ycombinator which is the organization that's funding them. Then I made another post on r/Alexis, who is an investor in ycombinator, it was promptly removed the next day. 

Finally someone personal messaged me, and we started a conversation. The usual back-and-forth took place, and it ended with his agreement that a monopoly and working with search engine's would be the best case scenario, but when I asked him if I could quote him, he said no, for obvious reasons. I then asked if I could speak to the top person, Santiago Siri,(he's done a Ted talk). Several more day pass with no activity on either thread, and then Santiago addresses me. After a short discussion he informs me that he has no interest in pursuing a monopoly.

So in the end everyone agreed that a monopoly was the best option from a worldwide perspective, and that a Google style search engine is the best humans to data interface ever created. And that this was a new perspective to them that they had not considered prior, but yet within an instant they have decided they do not want to give it any more consideration.

I sent apologies to each individual involved, and apologized on both conversation threads. It took another week or so before conversation there resumed.

I certainly felt like an asshole, but I have a goal that I have dedicated the next two years to, so I carry-on. 

By the way, I have a new sub, r/yourupinion, criticizing my plan goes over very well there, if you're interested?

I've worked there for two years, and it has treated me well for the most-part aside from some minor annoyances. One of these are inconstant hours, It's very common for me to get 20 hours one week, then 4 the next. I've dealt with it for the most part by picking up other people's shifts, but I would still like to work more. I've expressed this very clearly with little to no effect. 

Just a few months ago, my general manager (Head manager in the store.) introduced the ""lead"" program. This program promised people who wanted more work in return for a bit more responsibility. Think of it as a half-step to being a manager. Naturally, I asked about it, but the first time I did they said they would get back to me on it in the next few days. They never did, I got frustrated and decided to leave it alone. 

About two months ago, my manager approached me about a lead position. At the time I was gearing up for a trip to Australia, so I turned it down this time, but said that I would gladly take it if they could wait until I was back. 

I got back from my trip in early January to no word about the position, I asked the same manager again, who then told me she'd talk to another more appropriate manager about getting me set up. A week or so past with no indication, so I sought out the manager myself who walked me through the details and such. He told me that my first shift doing these duties would come up on Feb 19. Surprisingly, my schedule is emailed to me and I'm listed as ""Off"" on that day.

I'm pretty upset at that point, I had also found-out upon return that a good chunk of the employees in our store had also signed up to be ""leads,"" so the hours promised were likely going to be split between all of us that had applied. When the program was first announced, it was explained in a way that made it sound at-least a little exclusive, but it seems like anyone can just sign up as they please, regardless of work performance or tenure at the company. There are currently 20+. These positions are usually specific to a department, so for example you might of been the ""Lead of Men's"" or ""Lead of Fitting Room."" But with the amount of people signing up, the titles are getting oddly specific and minuscule, leading to titles like ""Lead of Women's Shirts."" and so forth. At this point, I feel like these titles are empty and I'm being patronized.

 I go speak to the manager that had given me the duties, only to get a ""Um, we'll look into it. We'll try to get you in on that day."" without so much as a glance. His back was to me the entire time as he worked on a computer.

 Fast forward to today and I'm in the process of transferring to a nearby Gap. I'm expecting a ""What gives?"" from my current GM sooner or later.

My best friend (let's say Alex) texted me a few weeks ago to not do anything on the saturday before my birthday. It was a surprise but they told me anyway. Turns out it was a beer fest ticket in a town ~40 min away. I was excited, thanked Alex because I assumed it was him, their SO (say Tim), my SO, and me. (Point that will come out later is Alex doesn't like beer so is usually the DD with events like this coupled with that they are not drinking until April for personal reasons) Come to find out that it isn't just us four but includes Tim's best friend and Tim's dad. I have hung out with them a bit but nothing to the point I'd think my birthday Saturday to usually include them. I'm ok with this however. 

Just recently I found out there have to be two cars to get there with all the people. Now except for Alex only my SO is willing to be the other DD. I was excited to experience a beer fest with my SO because we are short on time and money together and hardly go to bars cause it is too much. So something that is a gift to me will be hanging out during a beer fest with a sober Alex and my SO. 

Alex and and Tim usually go to these things a lot with Tim's best friend and his dad. I just feel it's not about me and how I'd like to experience my bday, but just coming up with them and my SO having to drive and me drinking with people I am not the most comfortable with. 

I understand to hang out sober isn't the worst thing but a beer fest is about about tasting all the beers you can and paying a premium for that. But I can't enjoy that beer experience with my SO as I would if they weren't the DD. And yes, sometimes when it's one of your last birthdays to get drunk with friends it's a big deal.

I did ask the girl out once a while ago, but it's not really that relevant. I'm not worried about him hooking up with her. Him and her have never had a conversation. I'm worried about me looking bad because I think he's acting creepy. I'm not scared about him ""stealing my girl"" or anything, I just think it's a weird thing to do to a friend of mine he doesn't know.

**TLDR**: I know a girl, my friend has only briefly been introduced to her. But he invited her and her friends to his birthday without asking me. I feel that's kinda inappropriate and puts pressure on her/the situation that I don't want.

Here's the situation:

Me and my friend (call him Alan) go to the same bar regularly, often together but sometimes without each other. There, a few months ago, I met a girl (Sally) and hooked up with her. Me and her have texted on and off since then, and hooked up a couple of times. She has two friends (Brianna and Melanie) she usually hangs out with, and usually one or both of them will be there if she is.

**Alan doesn't know Sally**. I do admit they've obviously been at the bar at the same time, and had the standard ('Alan this is Sally, Sally this is Alan') introduction I've given them, but they really don't know each other. We've bumped into them at the bar or a club, but they haven't gone beyond a very short conversation at the most. I'm not sure she even knows his name. I think he's had a very short conversation here or there with Brianna and Melanie when they saw me at the bar and he was with me.

Alan is aware I have a strange fragile relationship with Sally because I've told him about it. We text each other, flirt, make out alot, but don't date or really do any more than that. He understands that she will occasionally text me first and want to hang out with me, and then sometimes kiss me, but gets scared off very easily if I suggest anything like going on a date or coming home with me. I'm okay with this very casual thing we have, I'm just saying it's not as if me and her have something established or serious.

He's added them all on facebook, as he does with lots of girls I know that he even meets for two seconds. It seems that if I introduce him to a female, no matter how briefly, he adds them on facebook and comments on their posts and sometimes messages them. He's even added my friends he hasn't even met, just because he saw them on my profile and thought they were attractive. I find this creepy and inappropriate, and I've talked to him about it before. I didn't think he'd done it for a while, but obviously in this case he has. I guess it's a slight grey area because at least they go to the same bar, but it gets worse.

So this weekend is his birthday, and I just see he's done a facebook event to hang out in the city and go to a club. Fine. But he's invited Sally and her friends, and didn't mention it to me first.

I said that I thought it was inappropriate of him to invite them, especially Sally, without asking me. He didn't think it was wrong, and our mutual friend who was there for the conversation thinks I'm wrong.

I feel like he should have just not invited them at all. You know, like he did with my dozens of other friends he doesn't know. But he could have at least asked me if I want to bring her (I would have said no, too), and if I did, let me invite her - not just invite her without asking me. I feel that that reflects badly on me, and makes it look like I've asked him to do it, when it's in fact the opposite.

Am I the asshole?

My friend and I live across the country from each other, and we've been planning to go to a camping festival together for a few months now. It was my idea but I am completely reliant on them since they live closer to the event and we're taking their car. We've been planning all the details together and were both clearly looking forward to the event and spending time with each other. We have a bunch of mutual friends going, but we intentionally decided not to camp with them for mostly social reasons. 

BUT with the event less than two weeks away, my friend asked if I would be alright with possibly giving another person (i've never met them, but they are friends with the person i'm going with and we have like a dozen mutual friends on facebook) a ride to the festival and maybe letting them camp with us if they couldn't camp with their friends. Presented like this, I said of course, because of course we can give someone a ride to the festival, and the way my friend put it made it sound like that was probably all that would end up happening. A few hours later we talk again, and now this other person ""really wants to camp with us"" so that's cool with me right? Again I said sure, because I felt like wasn't given a choice; I'm reliant on my friend for a ride/car/camp setup to/at the festival, and they put me in an uncomfortable situation that was hard to say no to without instantly being the asshole.

I don't inherently have anything against camping with an additional person. Had my friend asked me before getting this other person involved so we could talk about how this would change our current plans, I don't think I would feel the way I do right now. It's clear from talking to the new person that my friend didn't explain the existing dynamic - that this new person is very much an addition to our plans, NOT a partner in organization - and I already feel like the two of them are ganging up on me to change our plans. I don't want to argue the specifics with them because it isn't about the details as much as WHAT THE FUCK OG FRIEND?

Part of me thinks I am just being a dick though, that I should just accept this additional person since there is nothing I can do about it, just try to go with the flow and still enjoy the weekend. I also don't know the details of how this person was invited; did they guilt my friend into joining us, like maybe they didn't realize that they would be imposing? My friend has never been to a camping festival before and has expressed some concern over the camping aspect but I have camped at festivals before and I thought we had addressed their worries - this new person ""is a festival kid,"" did my friend invite them to help us out? or to help the other person out because they didn't have anyone to go with? did they (either my friend or the new person) not understand the gravity of this change - I could see myself not understanding this before i went to my first camping festival, the scale and whole experience is hard to communicate until you have lived it yourself.

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Three years ago, I became a part of a group of friends that all went to a different high school than me. I became really close friends with some of them, including 'Robert' and 'Alice'. 

Robert had a crush on Alice for the whole time I knew them, but she has turned him down repeatedly. It came to a point when Robert would not come to gatherings if he knew Alice would be there and he asked me (and I assume others as well) not to mention her to him. 

This autumn, I went off to college, but I still kept contact with both of them (and other friends) and hung out with them when I came back to my hometown. I used to have a girlfriend back there, but we broke up shortly before Christmas because of the distance. After the holiday, I went back to the college-town and cut contact with my ex to make things easier for me. 

In the middle of January, Alice called me that her boyfriend dumped her and asked me to be friends with benefits. As I was still sad about my breakup, I accepted. She came to visit me recently and we fucked the whole weekend, it was awesome. 

I'm finally coming back to my hometown in a few days to meet with family, catch up with friends (including Robert) and also to fuck with Alice. **My first question is, am I an asshole for what I have done so far?**

I feel really bad every time I talk to Robert over the phone or Facebook because of this. But I also know that he told me not to mention Alice to him ever again. All the people that know that Alice and I hooked up also know that Robert does not want to hear a single word about her, so I'm confident he won't find out unless I tell him. **My second question is, should I tell him?** 

Telling him would definitely ease my mind, but I also know that it could hurt him. I guess I can bear feeling bad so that he does not have to feel bad. I also don't want to risk our friendship by telling him, but on the other hand I guess that friends should be honest. If I don't tell him, will it be a white lie or will it make me an asshole? 

EDIT with more details, if anyone is interested:

* if I were in Robert's shoes, I'd probably be upset but I wouldn't make a big deal of it. One of my best friends actually dated my high school crush for a while and I still managed to be friends with him. 

* when I talked to Alice after we hooked up, we actually found out that there were times when one of us was into the other, but we never knew or one of us was in a relationship then. 

* if it wasn't clear enough, we were both freshly out of a relationship at the time we made the arrangement. 

* during the time Robert had crush on Alice (it began before I knew either of them, I guess ages 14-16), she's had at least three boyfriends that I know of, so he really never had a chance. 

* no matter what the result of this post or the eventual outcome with my friend is, I'll continue casually hooking up with Alice until one of us finds someone more serious. Does this make me an asshole? 

* I'm going to see Robert probably once a month at most, Alice about the same, unless she decides to visit me in the college-town (this can't be the right expression, what's the proper one?). ",AITA for sleeping with my friend?,0.93,-inf,,,

I live in the city, while my parent's live about 20 minutes away out of town, so I put my hives there and my dad helps me take care of them and owns half the ""business"" (really, it's more like we share a hobby). For the past year, I've been driving out to their house every other weekend to check on and take care of the bees, which my father helps me with. Last year, we gathered about 100 pounds of honey from our bees, which is valued at around $10/lb.

My dad and I take turns buying equipment for the bees - wood for the beeboxes, tools to work them, bottles and labels to sell it, ect. In total, we've each spent around $400 on the hobby so far. Dad has sold around 20-30lbs of the honey to his friends and coworkers, while so far I have sold none, and taken no profits from the sales he has made.

A few weeks ago, my mom called me and told me the neighbor's daughter was asking if she could be given some honey, as she's in a 4H group (activity group for kids to get involved in farming), so she could sell it as part of the group. My mom is really good friends with her mom, so of course she said yes when asked, and called me to ask if it was okay.

There is a few reasons why this isn't okay. For one, it's *illegal* for us to sell honey for resale (it's only legal for hobby beekeepers to sell honey face-to-face), for two, I've poured blood, sweat, tears, and money into this hobby, and I don't want her to give away months worth of work. I worked really, really hard to get this honey, and I haven't seen a cent yet, so I told her hell no! *Maybe* she could have some honey *at cost*, **after** I took some to a farmer's market to see how well it sells.

A few weeks pass, and I find out today that mom gave her an entire *milk jug* of honey. That's over ten pounds! That's worth over one hundred dollars!

I call her, and I'm pretty pissed. She didn't even tell me, I find out through facebook because I'm friends with the girl's brother. Mom says since she put some work into taking care of the bees too (she painted the hive boxes with dad a few times, stuff like that), that she feels like she deserves to have some honey too - and maybe she does, but she's never had to spend a cent on it herself, and when I told her I'm out over $400, she didn't believe me. She has no real understanding of the amount of work I've put into the hobby or the expense I've paid, and thinks she's entitled to like 1/3 of the product because she's helped out a few times. She got mad over the phone, and said ""well, bill me then!"" and hung up. 

So I did, and went ahead and invoiced her for $107.17 - selling the honey at $9/lb (a bulk discount) + tax.

We had been dating for about 2-3 months. We agreed to continue being friends since we shared friends before, and saw no reason to not continue doing the same after the breakup. I was a little down, but all in all in pretty good spirits. Emma had her close friend ask me if I was okay later in the week, which was nice, and I told her that I was fine and nobody need worry.

We all went to a party about a week or so after this, got fairly drunk, and I got together with a girl who we are both friends with [also 19F], who I shall call Olivia. I was very good friends with her before this. We continued to see each other in the next few weeks, leading to now. 

Olivia and I (perhaps a fuck up on my part) decided to keep it quiet amongst our friends, and tried not to tell anyone about our arrangement. We were not sure how long we would want to keep seeing each other and didn't want to 'rock the boat' in the friendship group, especially since Emma and I had just broken up.

Emma finds out pretty quickly after her previously mentioned close friend somehow found out (not sure how) that we were making out at the party. She is quite distressed by this. I didn't find this out until she confronted me about all this recently.

We continue to see each other privately, and admittedly sneak off together after nights out (we are students). 

All was well until I got horribly drunk last week. We all went to a bar, where I arrived late. I was sort of pleased to find out that Emma has found some guy to pair off with for the night, as this makes me feel a little more justified in seeing Olivia. A few of us went back to someone in the groups flat, it was a group of about 5 of my closer friends (including Olivia, not including Emma or her closer friends). I let it slip when I was blacked out that Olivia and I were seeing each other (as she told me the next day as she filled me in). I woke up very embarrassed and swearing off the drink as per usual. I had however allowed our arrangement to become *public knowledge*.

Emma found out about this pretty quickly, and she later tells me she feels horrible. She says when she confronts me about it by text that I was wrong to hide it from her if I wanted to spare her feelings, made her ""feel like shit"", ""this has really changed my perception of you"". I keep my cool here and don't share with her my actual opinion on the topic of her involvement.

Now I shall show my bias. In my opinion, she has nothing to do with this, it's not her problem, she isn't my problem. She broke up with me, I don't believe in a grace period between relationships, I don't think she had a 'right to know'. In my view, **I owe her nothing at all**. I hold these opinions regretfully, because before this I really rather liked her.

My s/o was mainly telling me to stop, to not do it, that I'll get addicted, ""it smells rancid"", they'll tell my parents (I don't think they mean that one), that I'll get the munchies, eat too much, then hate myself for gaining weight. Near the end, they got passive aggressive (""fine. go the fuck ahead. i dont want to hear about it."" ""i dont agree with it, but go ahead."")

----

Historically in our household my parents never cooked, and the majority of the time we would grab fast food or order pizza. Over the past year or so I've been trying to shift away from that, fast food is expensive and unhealthy, and I'm in college trying to save money, so I started learning to cook. At first I would only cook for myself, but once I started showing off my creations to my parents, my dad agreed to start buying groceries more routinely in exchange for cooking dinner for everyone whenever I had the time. 

Over the course of me teaching myself, my sister has decided to join in too, she's started cooking basic things like Tuna Helper and instant Mashed Potatoes. I'm super proud of her for taking action, but the thing is...She never cleans up after herself, leaving stacks of dishes piled up for days, more than once has she left mashed potatoes just sitting in a pot on a counter for 3-4 days at a time. 

I know actually, because at first I made a joke about it, I would send little vlogs to my mom about it saying stuff like ""Day 3, still no sign of pots and pans being cleaned."" 

For further context, I started getting into habit of cleaning up my dishes immediately after using them. I used to do the same exact thing as her, and she would take the time to call my dad and tell him to tell me to clean the dishes. I took the advice/took action and followed through. 

Anyway, I've been on an absolute roll cooking wise lately, most of the stuff I'm doing have been really nice hits with the rest of the family, getting to a point where I cook 5-6 a week. Last night I made dinner, but left a bit of batter in a Tupperware bin last night. (Important in a second.) Acknowledging all the cooking I've been doing lately, my mom asked my sister to do the dishes this time to give me a break. I get a call earlier from my Dad, who's pretty upset, saying that my sister called him again, and that I should clean out the grease, batter, etc. from the pans once I'm finished with them. 

I got off the phone and was kinda heated myself, I've been studying, working, and cooking my ass off lately in addition to other household chores out of the goodness of my heart and was feeling a bit unappreciated, especially since my sis has done much worse than a bit of batter in a bowl.  I show my sister one of these vlogs (which were previously between me and my mom only.) clearly showing footage of her dirty stuff followed by a date and she freaks out and starts throwing things at me.

Everything's cooled off now and we've apologized to each other, but I'm still curious.

P.S. 

Last time I was here, I was angry with my situation at work. A bit of an update, I took my asshole status to heart and decided to talk to my boss directly instead of being passive. It turns out there was an open door policy I had no clue existed. I voiced my concerns and they totally understood where I was coming from. I'm working much more, have a position training new people, and I'm having a better experience there overall. Thanks /r/AmItheAsshole!

Three month later the shower weekend is upon us. It was a Sunday brunch shower. I receive a call from my sister telling me my grandfather has had a massive stroke and is in ICU. This was a Wednesday. I inform my sister I will be up as soon as possible. 

I inform my mother. (parents divorced and she happen to be at my house.) I inform my SO. I also mention that they want me up on Thursday. (the next day, he isn't expected to live through the night.) 

My grandmother AND my father call me the next day.(side note: ""father"" is the sperm donor that signed his rights away. He did not raise me, and we have not spoken in over 5 years.) They say they are in a ""holding pattern"" until the test results come back, until they no how much of his brain is dead, until they decide to place a breathing tube or not, etc. Grandfather has lived through the night but they aren't sure how much longer he can hold on.

(Side note: while my bio father didn't raise me, my adoption paperwork did not sever grandparents rights. Grandfather visited me often. Emailed me all the time. Taught me how to drive a standard. Taught me how to drive in snow. Gave me my first car. He also paid for half my tuition while I was in college.)

I break down at dinner that night. SO books me a ticket for Friday afternoon at dinner.

I was away during all this. I Skype in during the shower, greeted and thanked everyone for their attendance. I watched as SO opened our presents, had a friend take detailed notes, and wrote thank yous to all that attended as well as all that brought gifts. 

So's father that had so much to say arrived in town that Friday. (the day I left.) However, he could not stay for the shower, nor did he purchase a gift, because he had to fly to New York for Hamilton on Broadway that Sunday.

I proposed to my girlfriend last year and we're getting married in the summer. We've talked a lot between ourselves about the traditions associated with marriage, and the one balk at the most is maintaining the paternal line of surnames as standard. I don't think it's OK to have such a gender lopsided and overwhelmingly adhered to tradition which is based in a historical subjugation of women, and I love the idea of this being a symbol to my hypothetical future daughters (and sons!) that they can do whatever they want in life. I don't think that merging surnames or double-barrelling does enough to move towards equality. I'd prefer a society in which surnames are kept on a 50/50 basis by both genders. Realistically, though, I just think that people should have the choice to do whatever they want with their surnames.

My parents don't concur with my opinion on this. They are concerned that people will think I'm trying to sever ties to my family, or that I prefer my fiance's family to my own. They say that this will ruin the wedding for them and embarrass them in front of their whole family, implying that they were in some way bad parents to me (**they weren't!**). My mum in particular takes it as a personal insult. I've tried to explain my reasoning and ask if they'd say the same things if my sister took someone else's surname, but I haven't been very successful. 

The more it goes on, the more it becomes clear that they are more upset than I initially realised. At her most angry, my mum has said that doing this would distance her from me, my fiance and my children in the future, and that if the topic comes up at the wedding she would struggle not to cry or walk out. She keeps asking me why I want her to be upset on my wedding day just to make an ideological point, and I don't really have an answer.

If people want to argue about my reasoning for why surnames should pass down 50/50, I'm happy to do that, but that's not what I'm really asking.

 This story takes place over 3 years I met this girl when i was 16, she just move to town and was in a few of my classes. We ended up talking a little bit and ended up dating, she was my first real girlfriend and i was her first real boyfriend. her name was lily and she was such a sweet girl but had a lot of problems going on in her life, her father was physically and verbally abusive and her mother was a drug/ booze addict who was no help. The first time i met the mom she was had climbed up a tree saying people were trying to take pictures of her.  Lily would grab to me, she had no one else in her life to help her. i felt so bad for her and really cared about her and wanted to help her so bad. everytime something happened (which was daily) shed call me crying her eyes out begging for help. she had a lot of depression issues and anxiety issues and i had to leave class a few times just to go outside and calm her down. Months went by and everyday it was something new, she was becoming very depressed and cutting herself and i did not know what to do. I began to feel responsible for this girl, it was stressing me out so bad that I couldn't sleep for days. She loved me a ton, she would go out of her way to bring me presents, and would surprise me all the time. The issue is, i really cared about this girl, she was such a good person and didn't deserve any of this crap, i wanted to help her so bad. But after 4 months of dating, I couldn't take it, i broke up with her. Not even a week later she called me yelling that she needed me. that she had thrown up everyday and cutting herself since i left her, It made me feel sick, i felt like i had added to this horrific pain to her and got back together with her. i want to add too that there was plenty of good times, but it was difficult to be with her sometimes because i felt trapped. I never cheated on her, but she was very possessive and hated that i sometimes went to parties and would become mad at me for going. she had social anxiety and hated anything to do with substances (which i completely understand due to parents, i didn't drink or smoke weed much at the time anyways) A few months went by of again similar situations, and again i couldn't take it anymore, i felt like i had no choice but to break up with her and it killed me doing it, a few days later i get a suicide text, I try to text her back but get no response. I drive over to her house as fast as i could and find the mother drunk and lily on the ground not conscious with pills and vomit everywhere. I picked her up and drove her to the hospital and sat by her until she came to. she had taken a bunch of different pills, luckily she was ok, but they checked her into a mental hospital after that. i began tracking down people who had been admitted to that same hospital and asked them how it worked. i felt responsible for this ( even though i probably shouldn't have but i was 17) one of my closest family members passed away from cancer during this time and i was just a mess. I hadn't seen lily for 2 months, i was worried sick about her, every night i felt like i was going to throw up. after about 2 months of not seeing her, i began talking to this other girl that i had a crush on since middle school. We ended up talking at a party and exchanged numbers. I started to like her and ended up asking her to prom and she said yes. I had no idea when lily would be back, all my friends had dates and i didn't know if lily would be back. Plus at this time i started to lose feeling for her, and i liked this other girl more. Turned out it was just lust for this other girl and me latching on to something that wasn't real for the sake that i was miserable. Lily came back right before prom and i told her how i met this other girl and it pissed her off a lot. This is where i begin to hate myself, i wish i could go back in time and change some things here but what happened happened. I told lily id still be her friend and i'd be there for her for anything. We ended up having sex one day and then things got messy and gray. We were getting back together and breaking up every 4 days. Prom went by and i told her i wouldn't hook up with the girl i was going with. she didn't believe me and was very insecure and ending up hooking up with her date and called me late that night crying. After a few more fights and messy things, we ended up getting back together right before summer. Her going away to the mental hospital helped a lot, we were able to get her dad away from her for the most part and her mom was trying to get better. These were the best days of our relationship, that summer was incredible. She was doing great and i started to really like her alot. She still had some underlying issues but so do we all. After about 7 more months of dating i could honestly say i loved her. We still fought sometimes and there was still some dysfunctionality ( as in wed get in a fight and break up and then call each other apologizing). 
This next part is what killed our relationship. 
My friend group and one of my friends inside my friend group is dating a girl and her friends and my friend group would often hang out. I didn't like any of these girls, in fact i came close to hating them. They drank all the time and threw up and were gross. Lily would always find out when i was hanging with my friends and these girls and it would drive her crazy and she would become so mad at me. She didn't believe me that i hated them, she thought i really liked them and enjoyed drinking with them. Which was not the case at all. I used to beg my friends to not invite them because 1. I didn't enjoy their company and 2. I knew it'd upset lily. 
I understand why she didn't want me with them. Lily had this idea of me that i loved partying and i think she felt jealous of those girls. She probably was also worried that something similar would happen like with the girl i met at the party when she was away the mental hospital. We began fighting a ton about this, i tried so hard to tell her that i would never want any of those girls. This went on for months, we both eventually couldn't take it and broke up 3 months before college. I loved her so much, but we were fighting so damn much over this stupid thing. My friends were always with these girls, even though i hated them. We still talked all summer and even had a few last date things before she went to college and they were awesome. She left for college about 7 hours away and i stayed home commuting to a school cause i wanted to save money for student loans. She told me to never talk to her again 3 days after she got to college and blocked me on everything. I tried my best to reach out but nothing. I was fine for the first few weeks, then i began to realize what i lost. How much i missed her. It started to drive me crazy that she was at a school with 80% guys. I started smoking weed and drinking everyday, i couldn't eat, i couldn't leave bed, i was losing weight and throwing up everyday. I'm a little better now but this has been going on for almost 8 months now of me being like this. She texted me the other day how i'm a terrible person and that if i ever try to reach out to her again she's going to get a restraining order on me. She has a new boyfriend and i'm happy for her and all but like holy shit it just deteriorating me, i haven't been going to class and can barely leave bed. I really don't know what to do. Any help would be much appreciated.

He had been giving me a hard time that day, not in a mean way but acting like the annoying little brother I never wanted if u know what I mean. Just being obnoxious since he clocked in hours earlier. So then he asks if he can have the rest and I, jokingly, point to the price sticker on the box saying he had to pay for it. He said he would pay basically 65% of it and I agreed.

Myself and the guy involved in this story are good friends now, although when this happened he was pretty pissed for months. I've been thinking back to this and honestly can't decide which of us were the asshole in this situation so I figured I'd get a third party's opinion.

Alright, so like I said this happened around when GTA Online first came out and at that time there were **lots** of cheats/hacks/exploits going around. My friend took part in these exploits where as I did not, the specific things he did were:

* Join a hacked lobby so he was level 152 (incredibly high, I was only level 14)

* Got someone to hack him in tonnes of money

* Did a glitch to get a tank as an ""owned"" vehicle (this should not be possible, it meant he could respawn it cheaply and if you destroyed the tank you were penalized and even sometimes kicked for destroying someones personal vehicle)

Now I didn't mind him having all of these glitched/hacked stuff, I personally didn't take part in it but it never bothered me that he cheated because it didn't really effect me. Usually we played together just messing around in free roam (we were in a group of 5-6 usually if it's of any relevance). We did usually try and fuck with each other all in good spirited fun, blowing up each others cars, sniping each other off rooftops etc. We did this almost every night.

Now, the problem came in one night in particular, I can't remember what it was but I was trying to do something, most likely trying to earn money by robing shops (like I said I didn't cheat so I was usually low on cash while the rest of the group had more money than they could possibly spend). The friend who glitched/cheated earlier decided to fuck with me, now normally this would be fine but this one instance really pissed me off. Instead of just blowing up my car or killing me once or twice he continually killed me/destroyed my car.

Whenever he destroyed my car I have to spend about 2 minutes getting it back and he takes a penalty of ~$1000 (which didn't matter to him because he had so much money). He was using his tank to kill me, which like I said he glitched to get insured, so if I blew it up I lost ~$1000 (which at the time would have been like 1/10 my money gone each time). The first few times I didn't mind but after a while I was just like ""Dude, stop. I'm trying to earn money because I'm poor as fuck and I can't even fight back because your tank is insured and I'd just lose all the money I just earned). He was just following me around wherever I went and killed me, if I tried switching lobbies he'd just join that lobby and keep killing me again. 

So after about 20 minutes of this I was just like ""Dude, seriously. If you don't stop killing me I'm going to report you."" He just kind of shrugged it off, after 2/3 more times of me reassuring him I was going to report him he didn't seem to care. I did report him and even told him I reported him and he was just like ""Na, you didn't"" I logged off around that point because I was pretty pissed off after having losing literally all my money.

The next day I log on to find out he's not playing in our regular group and he unfriend me. I found out from the other guys that turns out they do read reports, and because I reported him for ""hacking/exploiting"" they looked at his account and seen ""Oh, he has a lot of stuff he really shouldn't have."" he was banned for about 30 days, when he was unbanned **ALL** of his stuff was gone. He still had his character but he was reset to level 1, his bank account balance was $0 and his apartment and all his cars (including the tank) were removed. 

I know that technically yea he did deserve to be reset, but I still felt like an asshole because he had invested weeks into that character and he also could no longer get the tank. (They patched the glitch but a lot of people still had them because they were reported and thus never reset.)

I broke up with her and left the city about a year and a half ago, but we stayed friends since then talking online about our lives. We've talked about new people we've dated, and a lot of other personal things. I grew to see her as a good friend.

 I had to come to Hong Kong again for business for three days and we planned to meet to chat. Nothing more than that, just a friendly meeting to hang out and talk. After I got here, she made excuses every day to not see me. The first day she said she was too bored to go out . The second day she said she couldn't go out because she had to have lunch with her friend and then her father bought her a cake and she had to stay home with her family.  The third day she said she had an allergy shot that made her face swell up so she didn't want to go out in public. 

 It seems pretty apparent to me that she has made excuses to avoid me the entire time I was here for whatever reason. I don't know her true motivation so I can't speculate on it, but her avoidance of me makes me think that she's not a true friend of mine. I told her as much and said there's no point in us being friends if I am not a priority at all. If a friend of mine came to visit where I live from another country for a few days, I would make a major effort to see him or her, regardless of gender or whether we dated in the past.

In all that time my parents have phoned me exactly twice, once to inform me that my grandmother died, and once at the suggestion of my brother (who still lives with them) to invite themselves to come around in a few weeks time for my thirtieth birthday. This would be the first time they have visited me. Otherwise, the only communication I get is the very occasional email informing me of things like them having surgery.

In return, I really only call for birthday's, Christmas, and mothers/fathers day, and once a year for Xmas I'll visit. But I never feel comfortable doing so. Since I moved out I've found it difficult to relax around them, every phone call and visit is extremely awkward and full of literally nothing but small talk. They have nothing to say to me, and I don't really have anything I feel comfortable saying to them. 

We've always had our differences. They are both fairly unintelligent people who take little interest in the world outside of whatever murder mystery is on TV at the time, and both of them struggle to show any ability to be genuine or nurturing, instead using efforts to mock and belittle whenever a serious issue was brought up. As such, I spent most of my teenage years telling them nothing, and it's now just routine. 

For example, if my SO was contacted by a recruitment agent about a possible job, she would inevitably call her family to discuss it. If it happened to me, I wouldn't even bother to tell my family, as I don't see it as any of their business at that stage, and would probably only tell my brother via Facebook if I actually changed jobs. 

I just don't feel comfortable speaking to them. I always get anxious when I have to, and I always end up stuck in a long conversation which is 10% greetings and 90% small talk about the weather, or people I don't know, or just otherwise irrelevant stuff. I don't feel I could call them for advice. I don't think they would give good - nay any - advice and I just can't bring myself to open up to them after years of silence and any earlier efforts to try to open up being met with snide jokes that I know are meant to be funny, but just come across as mocking.

Truthfully, I would love to have that close family dynamic my SO has. But, I don't really want it with my family, I want it with someone else's family, a family that actually respects and helps each other. After just shy of thirty years, my parents just feel like strangers to me, strangers who won't or don't make any effort to try and act closer, strangers who I'm not too sure I want to get to closer to, and sometimes feel like I only stay in touch with at all for my brothers sake.",AITA for not feeling comfortable with my own parents?,1.0,-inf,,,

Myself and my sister have a good relationship with eachother and our father, while neither myself or my father speak to my brother, and my sister rarely does. I have seen this affect my father emotionally quite a lot, as my brother also doesn't allow my father to see his granddaughter, my niece, who I have never met. My father has met the niece only once. 

I have been told by my dad that I will be receiving around 200k in the will, my sister 200k, and my brothers daughter (not him) around 100k. 

I argued with him that he has no part in her life and that this is ridiculous and insulting to me and my sister. This probably wouldn't bother me enough to argue except the fact that my father is not my biological father, I was born through a sperm donor, even though he's raised me my entire life, we do not share blood. 

Him leaving money to her feels to me that he does care about biology, while he's told me he does not, as he raised me as my father. 

I understand he can do with his money as he wants, but I also feel that actions speak louder than words, and leaving 100k is a big action.


EDIT for clarification from first reply:

I have no anger towards her, I just feel that she is no different from any other random girl. My father has met her once, and had no other contact with her. I don't know if I made this clear, but my issue is that he is leaving money for her, while he doesn't know her, solely because she is his biological granddaughter, while simultaneously telling me that sharing blood doesn't matter. So the fact is that he does care about blood, as he cares for her, even though he has never known her at all.

She misses school sometimes for hospital stays (usually only 2-3 days at a time now). She has some motor delays and speech impediments. She has absence and focal seizures that are easily mistaken for just zoning out or just being disruptive. I am very (possibly overly) sensitive to feeling like people underestimate her or see the worst in her. I tend to get upset with her school for how they grade or fail to reward her. 

Two recent examples: she got a horrible report card this semester. She was marked 'does not meet standard' on things I know she has down cold. In the conference, the teacher said flat out that they marked her down if she didn't say the exact word correctly because of her speech impediments. So she can identify a trapezoid and a sphere, but since she says crapasoy and spear, no credit. She can tell you if you are making the correct blended sounds, but since she cannot produce blended sounds like tr/pr she is marked down as not recognizing them and is essentially failing kindergarten- again. They already held her back. They also would cut her off if she did not answer within a few seconds, despite knowing and acknowledging that she has frequent absence seizures. 

Also, they gave awards to kids who made 100 days with no tardies or unexcused absences. She had neither, but they still did not give her an award. When asked afterwards, it was because she had no unexcused absences but since she had spent a total of 11 excused days (1 for a socio-psych eval the school requested, the rest in-hospital with extra homework to make up for what she missed in class), they said it just wasn't fair to the kids who saw her miss so many days, but the teachers son who was hospitalized for a few days more did get an award.


This particular example: My daughter loves the science fair and worked like a dog on her project. She ended up being the only kid in her grade to complete one. She was awarded second place for her grade. I asked the admin about it later when I returned to pick up the project at the end of the fair and was told since it was a 'solid B grade project' they had made the call that it was more appropriate to give her a second place and just not give out a kindergarten first place at all. I am livid. I feel like they'd rather throw the ribbon in the trash than reward my girl. On the other side, my daughter is thrilled to have won a ribbon and she still qualified to move on to the county fair. She is proud of her second place. I don't want to diminish that for her, but I think giving her second when she was literally the only one in her category is utter bullshit. AITA for wanting to take the admin to task over ribbon color?


UPDATE: Thank you everybody. After having others in my life try to convince me, it took coming to a spot where anonymous internet users were freely encouraged to tell me I was being the asshole to come to terms with the fact that I have allowed myself to be gaslighted by the school. They put so much effort into convincing me I was just over-protective and not savvy and impartial enough to get the bigger picture. I know that letting them plant doubts about my instincts has been to my daughter's detriment. Her dad and I have been planning and trying to make some big decisions over the weekend. We have called for an IEP meeting because it is the easiest way to get all the major players in this debacle in one spot. We have reached out to advocacy groups in Oakland and Sacramento because we can't find one closer yet (we are in one of the more rural spots in Nor Cal). Her dad is absolutely dead set against her going to the other kindergarten available. He wants to make this school work, but based on the advocacy groups suggestions he is also willing to consider homeschooling. I don't think this is an ideal option for her, but supplemented with things like dance classes, T-Ball, etc. for socializing I think we could make it work. There is a small local paper (about 1500 circulation, but like a rabid dog with a bone, and they have squared off with the school system before) and her dad knows people involved with Chico States' Orion, but we won't take that step until we meet with an advocate for some guidance and to lay out the paper trail we have.

I hate parties because of this and other social gatherings, because for me there isn't any type of base interest in others.

I try to smile at people and be friendly but eventually they figure out that I'm not really interested in them and that I just sort of have nothing to talk about. Whenever I do this, and be intentionally friendly to someone, like a coworker, or a cashier at a store I go to a lot, I become really anxious and I wonder how much longer I can keep it up. Like, how much longer can I act this way until they realize that I'm extremely socially awkward, and that I'm just kind of a small person. 

I am super socially awkward and anxious. I've always been that way.

We lost touch for years and she just recently added me on social media and left a strange comment. But I admit, I would say things that I prob shouldn't have to her: When I was leafing through her high school yearbook I condescendingly said: ""Gabby, when did boys start noticing you?""

When we were at a bar, I would try to stir shit, telling Gabby that a random girl at the bar was pointing at her and talking crap, muttering ""that girl has big tits and a flat ass"" about Gabby, when that didn't happen. I loved watching her get worked up over it.
One time when she was changing in front of me, I laughed at her body and said ""You've got the ass of a 7 year old boy!""

I'm now wondering if I was too harsh... my other gf's and I joke around a lot, but Gabby never stood up for herself. She had introduced me to one of her new friends, Tiffany, who not only moved in with us, but I ended up becoming really close to, and the 2 of us kinda ganged up on Gabby. I resented the fact that Gabby's dad was a doctor and paid for everything of hers, and that she tiny with a perfect body (huge boobs though no butt), while I was flat and had an occasionally abusive dad.

Shit hit the fan a year later and Tiffany & I ended up having a huge falling out and stopped talking. So I ended up sending Gabby an email a year or 2 later sending a half assed apology, which she accepted, and told her she could have one of my pets who was more connected to Gabby than me, who I couldn't give attention/affection to. Gabby accepted and told me that I'd need to bring all of the cat's updated vet info, and she invited me to her new brand new condo that she secretly got while living w Tiff & I. **Her intention was to leave Tiff & I stranded as she shopped for a new condo behind our backs, and was going to move out without telling us, to leave us stranded/high & dry That's pretty petty, passive-aggressive and catty, don't you think?**

Anyway, we lost touch for YEARS after that but she found me on social media and added me, and I did the same. She looks good, happy, is traveling around the world a lot, doesn't look like she has kids or a husband. I just had a baby so I'm posting nonstop pics of her. Gabby just recently sent me a private message saying ""i'm so glad to see you're doing well...I remember back in the day you were pretty broken :( .. good to see youve picked yourself up.

I then remember that she didn't drink and ask her if she can drive us back, no. She says no because she's scared of driving downtown, she doesn't know the way, and is afraid with the one ways and the trains in the road(some lanes are public transit only). I live and deliver in the downtown area so I know every possible way back to my apartment and which lanes to stay on and off. I ask her again because I don't want to leave my car and have to buy another trip back there before parking fares start at 8, she refuses. I'm like ""ok E is driving"", I know he is good to drive. She then looks and me and tells me ""you hate me."" and proceeds to ignore us. So I tell her,"" Look! You haven't had anything to drink tonight and you want us to pay for a ride back at 2x the rate with surge prices, I know the way and I know how to navigate through downtown. You're being really selfish right now."" She gets even more mad and ignores us the whole night after that. I let E drive us home. Was I out of line to yell at her?

I was confused at first and said ""excuse me?"". And then she starts berating me about how she can't believe I would do this to her and that she is a regular customer and she doesn't deserve this kind of treatment. 

It finally clicked to me that she was talking about giving the 99 cents in change. I don't know if it was the mean attitude that she gave me or that while she was a regular customer, she would make me wait for her orders because she was on her phone previous times but I just did not feel like complying. I answered that $2.99 was what the change came out to be and tried handing her the coins. She waved the coins away, took her desserts and $2 change and walked away while calling out how ridiculous this situation was and that she will never support the shop again.

That being said growing up fighting has lead to a very uncomfortable feeling when being touched. My friends know that is a boundary and respect it.

Then he asked me if I knew how things spread, Chlamydia in particular. I said I'd be wearing a condom and then he said ""you didn't answer the question"". I explained quickly and then said ""you're talking to a biologist"" (I'm studying biology).

After that he got really irritated. Said stuff like ""you're not a fucking biologist"", ""you're a student, you're studying biology"". After that he said ""you can never give yourself a status, NEVER. Only people around you can"", ""if you say that you're cool, you're not cool.

He started making comparisons like saying he's a neurosurgeon because he saw a YouTube video and whatever. I said I thought he was overreacting, to which he replied ""no, that's how it works"".

I said that ""biologist"" isn't a protected title, to which he replied ""oh, then I'm a biologist too"". 

I left a very tiny part of our conversation out, but he ended saying that my logic was stupid.

The reason I said I was a biologist was because I didn't feel like he needed to ask me questions about STDs. I did not anticipate his reaction to what I thought was a pretty harmless statement. My point was that I'm studying biology, so I know that stuff. I felt like he was underestimating me.

Did he go too far? Am I the asshole? Are we both assholes?

I shared this experience with another friend of mine, he said it was pretty douchy of me to call myself a biologist when I'm not. We're still talking, so I won't share that whole thing.

I realise this is the tiniest argument and that it doesn't really matter, but I'd like to know if I was a jerk or if I said something stupid.

I (M20) live at my parents' house, and my mom usually drives me to uni (she works nearby). The last two days I overslept, and my mom had to wait for me to get ready (10-15 minutes). I often have problems getting up in the morning, but I'm hardly ever late by more than a minute or so, and I've started getting up at 7 am every school day to try and get a more stable circadian rhythm.

This morning I heard my parents talking about my problems getting up in the morning while putting my clothes on, saying things like ""I don't know what we should do with him"", ""Maybe we should cut his internet at night"", etc. and I just got irrationally angry about it. I felt really disrespected, like, why couldn't they talk to me directly, or at least make an effort to talk about it at a time where I couldn't hear them? I know this doesn't really qualify as talking behind my back - it's not like they were talking shit - but I had just gotten out of bed, and ended up getting quite angry.

Anyway, I went into the kitchen and started making my breakfast, and said ""Maybe you could talk *to* me instead of *about* me?"" to my parents. Later, in the car, I explained to my mom why it had made me so mad, and while I was raising my voice quite a bit, I think she could see where I was coming from. We agreed to discuss the oversleeping thing after we get home.

When I got home I sat down with my parents, and my dad and I got pretty mad at each other. I told him the same thing I've told you, that I felt disrespected, yada yada, and he called me disrespectful for living at their place and messing up their daily schedule. I can definitely see where he's coming from, but he wouldn't agree that what they did was disrespectful in the slightest and said that it wouldn't even have happened if I had just got out of bed on time, and that, again, made me furious.

I have this problem where I get along fine with friends, but easily get mad and act like an asshole to my family members, and I know that I definitely overreacted. Also, I understand that me not getting out of bed screws with everyone's day, and I'm really trying to better myself.

Me: Yeah apparently I'm weird because I wanted to get out the feelings of a breakup I wasn't expecting.

Just because you got your feelings hurt doesn't mean you can do whatever the fuck you want.

Me: You assume that I shared it with people to get at you. You aren't that fucking important. I shared it because I thought it was a cool story. Sarah showed hers with the group so I told her I used her idea and everyone else wanted to see it too. That's all that happened.

Her: I never said you did it to get at me. I know you did it because you just wanted to because you didn't fucking care to ask if I was okay with that and fuck what sarah does. That's her choice and whoever she fucking wrote about.

Me: Whatever. It's my business too so I didn't think I had to ask you. I honestly shouldn't have let you read it. Plus, I didn't share the really personal stuff because I have respect for you.

I've had a sour ending with a childhood friend, 10 years of friendship.

I come from a fucked up family where one parent leaves and comes back with my siblings, and then the other leaves and alternate. 3 years ago however, one of them ended up in jail and the other one left with my siblings - thus I was alone to fend for myself. I never use to choose sides, but this time I did and I chose to side with the parent in jail. Other parent decided that they did not like this, and that they'll try everything in their power to make me homeless (I'm male, at the time 16) so I ended up staying at this house, that house, and sometimes even on the street.

Best friend (call him John) at this time was there for shits a giggles, and I appreciate that, but he wasn't there at all emotionally whatsoever, nor did I expect him to be. So you know, I didn't care, I strut my own game and did what I had to do with the parent bullshit, and he was there for a laugh.

After parent comes out of jail, they decided to get back together again, and this time I had enough so I left the country to live with other family. I had to move away from everything, this was the place I grew up in and of course, because I was the one leaving the parents, the parent that tried making me homeless blamed everything squarely on me. (Funnily enough, they've broken up again).

John told me he's gonna miss me and all that, but it all felt forced. Anyway, I didn't care. In the last 2 years I've been back to that country and met him. Shits and giggles like the usual.

Last year, however, he started chatting shit about how I'm being dickhead to my mother and I need to straighten up. And he said it multiple times - so I'm shook at how a dude who I grew up with cannot empathise with the fact that I went to hell and back because of my mother, and that had me doubting myself for days. I told him how much it impacted me and told him to clear up what he meant just to give him the benefit of the doubt (nobody, apart from strangers, tell me to respect my parents). Having asked him, he didn't reply, *waited around for roughly a month*, so I took that as a notice to end our 10 year friendship and block him off social media and out of my life.

Fast forward to this week, he's been getting numerous friends of his to tell me to talk to him, giving me his number so I could give him an explanation as to why I've disappeared. I thought about it and did just that. I told him why, and I LET IT KNOWN that I wasn't pursuing a friendship or anything, nor did I have anything against him, and I also acknowledged that I should have let it be known why I blocked him when I initially blocked John. He replied with insults and shit like 'you're so childish, how could you do this to someone who has been there for you and someone you've grown up with?' Then John decided to lecture me again about how I'm treating my mother is wrong.

I was gonna reply, but then he blocked me. What it feels like to me is that he's manipulated the whole situation to make it look like I wronged him when really he wronged me. But I'm even doubting that now.

I unblocked him on social media out of curiousity about an hour ago, and I seen that he's been indirecting me saying shit like 'some people are so irrelevant' and that 'people are temporary'. He begged me to contact him, didn't like what I had to say cos it hurt his ego or whatever, and twisted the situation completely to make me seem in the wrong.

So now I feel hella insecure and I'm not even that certain whether I'm the one who was actually a dickhead. Please help?

If he was the one who was a dickhead, my life has been spent being fucked over by people who should be there for me the most. I feel an unbelievable rage atm and if you can give me an idea as to what I could do in order to solve this, then it'd be appreciated.

edit: what I meant by that last remark is, how should I get back at him? I feel like that's the only thing that will settle how I'm feeling.

He says he's mad at me because he's sick of ""having to do everything"" around the house. Which -is- technically true, but I think he's ignoring some key points:

A) I never ask him to do any housework - he does it because he prefers a tidier house than I do (he likes a clear sink, I'm happy to let the few dishes we use stay 'til the weekend, etc.). Plus, he never asks me to do any chores for him before just going ahead and doing them anyway (and usually rejecting my help when I offer it because I don't do things fast enough or thoroughly enough for him).

And B), he doesn't work or contribute to the bills at all, whilst I work a stressful job all day and don't usually get back until late evening. He's not a student either, though he's planning to go back to education soon-ish. I don't want to say that obligates him to do more chores, and I wouldn't dream of forcing him to 'earn his keep', but it feels like he expects me to both work and do all the chores for him while he plays his game for 30 hrs straight. 

With those points in mind, I don't feel like he's justified in getting mad at me. But he's still sitting in the other room ignoring me and making me feel like a shit girlfriend, so I don't know. Am I the asshole here?

TL;DR: My boyfriend's mad at me because he's ""sick of having to do everything"" around the house.

We're both PC enthusiasts but he also spends long hours studying. In the past, while staying with our dad, we both got some hand-me-down office chairs that were, to put it frankly, beat to shit and not very good. They were uncomfortable and very bad for both my brother's and my backs.

At our mom's, however, which we recently moved back to, I have a much better office chair which is adjustable in several ways, most notably, the actual seat of the chair can be tilted forward or backward. My brother is exceptionally tall and needs a range of adjustment, otherwise he gets back pain or his legs fall asleep. 

My brother has asked me to switch chairs, and I did refuse, but assured him there was room for consideration. I just was not prone to do so at the time. 

Recently, while I was sleeping, my brother took my chair from the basement and replaced it with his, either not expecting me to notice or not expecting me to care. I did notice, and care. This made me quite livid, which I believe is fairly understandable, as he instead of asking me again decided to go behind my back. I understand my brother needs the chair, but now I feel less inclined to give it to him.

My brother has the means to get a chair of his own. Our mom would likely be very supportive of buying or giving him one more suited to his needs, and he is far from being broke himself. This has been my chair for a very long time and it frustrates me that he would rather just take mine than get another. This is also after he stole shelves from my room, which I decided to let go.

My brother however has started to make petty threats, like saying he'll take his room back (I'm currently in his old room, he moved to a different one) among others. I understand that this would help my brother; however the manner in which he's handled this has made me less inclined to give it to him. Pardon the wall of text, but Am I The Asshole?

**TL;DR: Brother has back problems and wants my chair because it's better. I said no, but was open to consideration. Later, before asking me again, he stole it from me and replaced it with his.

So I told her if she ever made me take it again I wouldn't forgive her for it. That she was forcing me to disrespect my own beliefs. 

She respected that, to a degree. She no longer made me take it but she would still buy it for me and ask me over and over to take it just for her. I told her if she ever provided me with any proof that it worked I would take it. That was a mistake. 

She kept coming to me with anecdotal evidence and I had to explain that it was bullshit evidence each time.

She speaks English very well, because she's lived in the States for the past ten years. She's originally from Chile and speaks Spanish as her mother tongue. 

Up till now she's always tried her best not to speak in Spanish in front of me whenever I was around, which is unnatural for her since she exclusively speaks in Spanish with her son. She must've gotten mad at me for something again, because the last time I was at their place, she completely ignored me and spoke to her son only in Spanish. The same thing happened yesterday. 

Her behavior makes me feel like she's not acknowledging my presence and she's doing it out of spite, because she usually gets mad at me and I would have no idea. For example, she admitted to my boyfriend that she conscientiously ignored me on my birthday because I forgot to wish her a good flight one time. This happens relatively often, and I'm wondering if this is just one of her petty behaviors. 

On the other hand, maybe she just doesn't have the patience anymore to translate the stuff she has to say to her son, because she's getting old and going through menopause and has rheumatoid arthritis, which she tends to blame a lot of her behaviors on. Maybe I'm being too sensitive and I should just brush it off. 

My boyfriend brought the issue up with her already and she denies doing it completely, so I don't know how to solve this small problem.
